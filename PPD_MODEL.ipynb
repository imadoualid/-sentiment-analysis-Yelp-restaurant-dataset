So, given my positive experience, I decided to buy a mattress and box spring from Ikea - something that would need to be delivered.\n","\n","I went to Ikea having done my research and narrowed my decision down to two mattresses. I went alone, thinking that customer service would be able to help me if needed.\n","\n","Here's where it went wrong:\n","\n","-The woman in the mattress section told me delivery cost $  for the mattress I was buying. It was $ .\n","-To purchase the mattress, I had to put it on a cart and bring it through the till. Not a big deal, but there was only one of me, so I needed help getting the mattress on the cart. The guy working in the furniture \"self-serve\" section was blatantly pissed off about having to help me, and told me to \"wait over there\" while he chatted with his friend. I could hear them. They weren't talking about work. (Tall, skinny, blonde guy with longish, greasy looking hair. Avoid him.) After I \"waited over there\" for a while, I went back and asked again. *Loooong sigh* he came to help me load the mattresses.\n","-I then proceeded to navigate the cart with the mattress and box spring, alone, to the till. Notice again the one person, one set of eyes challenge. I was clearly struggling, and would have very much appreciated help at this point. \n","-Till closed while I was in line. No explanation. Proceed to move mattress and box spring to another till.\n","-Delivery. Here's where I learn the cost was $  more than anticipated. BUT, they could deliver after work, between   and   pm. Great - I'll pay $  + HST for that. \n","-Day of delivery.   am. While I'm at work, I get a call saying they are outside my house with the mattress. The Ikea dispatcher had messed up the order and given it to the delivery guys too early. Of course I can't accept it at this time. I ask \"Can they deliver it later?\" Maybe.\n","-Maybe!? I called Ikea themselves, and they guarantee that the mattress will be delivered between   and   pm.\n","- :  PM (note: NOT between   and  ) - I've rushed home from work to find the delivery guys in my hallway. They've disturbed my building manager to get inside. Here's the thing - I don't blame them. The IKEA DISPATCHERS made them wait outside for   hours. I was mortified at having been the cause of this, and angry at Ikea for having such a blatantly we-don't-give-a-f*ck attitude. \n","\n","Clearly, poor customer service and a blatant disrespect towards employees and suppliers is endemic within the organization. Sure, I got my mattress fine. Will I ever buy something big from Ikea again? Not a chance. Overall, it was a terrible experience.\n","I used to live in the area and go here often, well maybe not so much, but quite a few times, but I don't get by often these days.  I no longer live in Steveston, but on the east side of town.  I finally got to go this day with a friend who likes to walk, so we got off the bus near Trites, did a tour of Britannia and then took off to the Boot.  I was hoping my friend, owner, Penny still owned the place, because I hadn't seen her in five years, or so, and she was.  \n","\n","This is a small, unpretentious Canadian \"greasy spoon\" - I mean this with kindness - and I was interested in seeing if any changes   were made to the decor, which was dated, or the food.  Luckily, some friends of the owner decided it was getting a little dated, and she couldn't afford to do anything about it, so they all pitched in and repainted the place, and ditched the way too old blue carpet, and put in hardwood flooring.  The place was looking a lot more spiffy than the last time I visited, but as I kept telling the friends I introduced to the cafe, that you're not eating the carpet, just the food :-)\n","\n","Both myself and my friend had burgers, and compared to the mystery meat you often receive at the fast food places, we both recognize these as beef burgers, and very good ones at that.  I had the cheeseburger, and my friend had the Boot burger.   Can't remember the exact prices but they were somewhere in the six dollar range, and nothing on the menu is over $ . .  That's about one dollar higher or more than it was last time I visited a few years ago.  Definitely good value for the money as nothing was greasy.  The home-cut fries with their skins on were good, maybe too much so, as I'm a type II diabetic trying to keep the carbs down, and I  ate them all... my bad.  But I did make up for the other day at another restaurant by telling the server to hold the rice and give me extra salad.  She told me I'm the only man who's ever asked for more salad :-)\n","\n","Anyway this cafe is a one-person operation except during the busy period when she has one cook working with her, so it's no surprise that the menu is small - two small pages.  No wasting time trying to figure out what you want to eat, but many of the \"greasy spoon\" cafe staples were on the menu.  I think there was even a salad in their, maybe two, but hey, we didn't come here for salad.\n","\n","Many years ago a friend and I went there, and we had our usual inexpensive, but tasty lunch or breakfast or whatever we had.  I remember ordering Manhattan style clam chowder, which was very flavorful, but missing clams, so I brought this to Penny's attention telling her it was the  \"best vegetable soup I've ever had, but where's the clams?\"  Penny replied in her typical fashion that she \"had the clam on a string, and pulled it out before serving.\"  That's what you can expect eating here.  Good, unpretentious food at very low prices with a dollop of humor for a side dish. :-) Thanks Penny, you made my day.\n","Spontaneously dropped by after work and ordered the following:\n","\n","-Buck a shuck oysters ( / ): There are   types of oysters to choose from Kusshi, Kumomoto, Chef's creek and Sawmill fanny bay. Of course, I got one of each to try. To my disappointment they didn't look fresh and a bit small. Not what I was expecting from a seafood house. Probably that's why they got this promo going on.\n","\n","-Coconut prawn and scallops ( / -$ ): You get three prawns and two scallops served to you in a spoon filled with coconut milk broth. This was super delicious. Both the prawns and scallops were cooked perfectly and the coconut milk broth was a delight. The side salad it came with was weak. It had no dressing and was just greens put on a plate.\n","\n","-Appetizer platter ( . / -$  pp): It consists of Abacore tuna tartare, Qualicum Bay scallops wrapped in European double smoked bacon, mandarin orange and lime sauteed tiger prawns, smoked salmon and goat cheese timbale. The tuna tartare was disappointing. The tuna was dark in color (not the good one). It's suppose to be a vibrant red, but no this didn't look nor tasted fresh. It was served on top of a deepfried nori which was not crunchy either. The scallops wrapped in bacon was tasty. The prawns were also good. I liked the sauce that came with it. Tasted like herbs with butter and a bit of citrus but I remember the server saying something about brandy. The smoked salmon & goat cheese is pretty straightforward - can't go wrong with that. The crostini that came with it tasted good. It was drizzled with some balsamic. Yum!\n","\n","-Rack of lamb ( / -$ ): I asked for medium rare but it came out medium well done. That's a fail. BUT it was so tender and still moist I did not complain. It was well seasoned and didn't require any sauce. Looking back at the menu in hindsight, I didn't get any prosciutto and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a brandy sauce. It tasted like a red wine reduction that was taken too far that it turned sour with a slight bitterness. Oh this dish was so elegantly plated that it came with an edible flower that looked like an orchid....and I ate it. I asked first though. Verdict: Flowers aren't really my thing.\n","\n","-Chocolate bomb ( . / -$ ): Usually not a chocolate fan but ordered this for the theatrical effect. I sort of got it. It certainly wasn't what I saw others had on their instagram. The chocolate shell was lovely. Very rich and sweet chocolate flavours mixed with some peanuts. This would pair well with a cup of espresso or simply milk. \n","\n","Drinks:\n","\n","-Full sail ( / -$ . ): Pineapple, vodka and gingerale\n","-Elderflower fizz ( / -$ . )\n","-Sangria ( / - Free with yelp check -in)\n","\n","Overall, I'd give this place a  .  star rating with a round up to   stars. The service was mediocre. They cleared our table as soon as we're done with our food and topped our glasses frequently. They didn't clean our tables despite it being dirty and doesn't provide new cutlery until asked.\n","The worst dining for   experience EVER!!!!  I've been going to this restaurant for over   yrs. and food used to be amazing. It used to be my favorite restaurant for Sichuan food. Past few years the food's been going downhill, but still good enough, until I ate there last night. \n","\n","So, I went there around   pm and ordered about   or    dishes including their crab which I get most occasions. When the crab came out, it looked very small and didn't look right. So, I counted the legs and found   claws and   legs total. There were   legs missing. I don't even mind missing leg. As I tasted the crab, it didn't smell that fresh. I didn't want to make a big deal, and just ate it because I didn't want to embarrass my friend. In my mind I knew I got a dead crab that's been dead for awhile. Normally, they bring out the crab live on a pan for you to inspect and approve before cooking. This time they just brought out the cooked crab. Even if they bring it out live, I've seen restaurants change it in the kitchen. I knew  % it wasn't the one in the tank as I eat tons of crab and I know by taste and texture. As matter of fact I looked at the tank and saw about   in there before. When I looked at the tank again it looked same as before, and I don't remember anything swishing around the tank as We were sitting   tables away. The meat was little mushy this time and off tasting. But anyhow I kept to myself. \n","\n","The total bill was $  with no drinks, which I expected. I went up to pay the bill, and asked the lady who I think is the owner, how much they charge for the crab. She said its $ , which was stated on the bill. So I asked her how much per pound? Which is how we're normally charged in Chinese restaurants. She said $  for one any size, which doesn't make any sense. I told her the crab was very small and not fresh, hoping she caught on to what I was implying. She immediately walked into the kitchen, and I thought was going to talk to the chef, but when I sat back down at my table, she never came back. There was no sorry, or that crab is fresh because it was from tank, or anything. \n","\n","So, at this point I'm getting more pissed off after bad crab. Normally I'm a generous tipper with good service or food, and still tip fair share even with bad food or service. This is the first time I didn't want to tip. So, I left $  cash on the table and walked out hoping she would know why. \n","\n","So, this next event is what prompted me to write a review. As we were walking to the car, I hear the owner calling us, and as I walked back toward her, she says \"excuse me why didn't you leave a tip?\"\n","Now, this really pissed me off even more. I explained to her about the crab in detail, and she never once defended anything about the crab and never a sorry about anything. I told her she served me a dead crab and walked away. \n","\n","They want to rip me off on my meal, and chase me to parking lot to ask for tip????? PLEASE. HOW LOW CAN THEY GO?\n","\n","If you ever eat here, make sure they bring out a live crab from tank to show you, so you can make sure you get the same crab when it's cooked and not switched in kitchen. They may fool some customers sometime, but not all.\n","When someone talks about drinking and food, I now think of this place. I've had good times here, food does play a part to it, but the atmosphere helps, in this case, quite a bit. My favorite nights here are Friday and Sunday night, that is when DJ Alibaba is in control of the music and is not just DJ'ing.. he is VJ'ing. He's taking request on what to play, but on both those nights he is playing up to the crowd while we down our drinks and eat our bar food in enjoyment. But this is Yelp, your going to ask me \"how's the food?\" it's actually not bad, there is a reason why this place is packed on most days!\n","\n","Just know what day your going, cause everyuday at this place there are specials, food and drinks, sometimes both, sometimes just one, also look out at the chalk board which I saw some other specials on one of the nights I was there. This place is definitely a 'wing's' joint on Wednesday's and Sunday's. Some of the best chicken wing's in town from hot, honey garlic, teriyaki, bbq, sweet Thai, and salt & pepper, they are plump and juicy, no small dried up alien pieces of wing that I usually see when places have these cheap nights! After a basket of these bad boys, I was stuffed, with a beer on the side, I didn't want any food, usually at other bars I probably could go digging into the bone pit for more little wings, but as I said, they don't cheap out, and each wing is plump and good.\n","\n","I have come also on Thursday, during their steak night, and it seems the people know where to come, packed, I'm hovering around like a vulture, or a crow, waiting for someone to pick up their butt and get along with their day and allow me to sit, get here early, or just be prepared to wait. Seating throughout the place almost guarantees a view of one of the many flat screen tv's they have if your here to catch the game, and if your here for DJ Alibaba's nights, he is mixing the music with the video's and if you go up and ask him, he may play one of your request, but he makes sure people are bobbing their heads, and on occassion people are dancing on the small dance floor!\n","\n","On the nights we came, the staff was very attentive, and even sitting at the bar, the bartender introduces himself first, ask your name, and remembers it throughout the night you are there and calls you by it, if you wanted anything else. It's in an odd location, but in some ways an awesome location, as if you come during afterwork, peak hours, you see the sea planes take off and land here, as the bar is situated at the terminal to these metal birds.\n","\n","Another cool thing they do is that they have a shuttle van, to take you away to the closest Skytrain, especially if you get lost here and have a few too many. Warning to all those who drive, this is a bottleneck, one way in, one way out, and potential for the boys in blue to check anyone who has left this establishment, play it safe people, so you can come here, and anywhere else again to play another night! So, they even have your safety in place, but for a good night of drinks, food, music, come here, especially on Friday's and Sunday's!\n","I heard about Sura from a curious friend, who told me that it was one of the higher rated Korean restaurants she found online, and we had the opportunity of satisfying our curiosity last week. When we arrived at the entrance (Tropika's former spot at Aberdeen Centre), we noticed a small line forming and assumed that it really must be popular. Upon closer inspection however, we realized that the staff - although not lacking - was merely unorganized. One girl was very languidly placing used appetizer dishes into a bus pan. Several tables were empty but yet uncleared. Meanwhile, the queue was growing longer and potential patrons were congregating at the doorway as Sura did not have a hostess. The decor was very interesting - clearly based on low tables of ancient oriental cultures but done in a very modern fashion. One downside to the boxy seats is that I don't think they fully utilize the available space; Tropika had maybe three times as much seating during their time. Finally we were seated at a quiet table in the far corner. \n","\n","We spent a good deal of time trying to figure out which combination of dishes would give us the best value for money. We decided against the set courses since we thought $ /person was too much for lunch and instead got a pajeon (seafood pancake), japchae (potato noodles), and a bibimbap (stone bowl mixed rice) as these common dishes would make it easier to compare Sura's offerings to that of other Korean restaurants. The bibimbap came first. The server who brought it asked us how much hot sauce we wanted and poured on an approximate amount. She then proceeded to mix it all in at the edge of the table, effectively wasting the dish's visual presentation as we were left with a mixed up bowl of rice that had two spoons stuck in it. The japchae and pajeon soon followed after, and we saw that the portions were all quite small. The bibimbap was gone quickly, but the japchae was less so, as it was incredibly greasy. We did not even want to finish the remaining bites of it as it was swimming in oil. The pajeon had nicely crisped edges and with a good amount of seafood, but for $  it was disappointingly small (about  \" across), and I have certainly had better. \n","\n","Everything was accordingly sized - the water and tea glasses were tiny, holding about  . The tea was unexpectedly hot and one of my friends burnt her mouth at the first sip. The appetizers, typically an array of  -  small dishes elsewhere, were a meagre selection of three tiny mouthfuls of kimchi, eggplant and marinated cucumber. \n","\n","Our server, albeit friendly, was not the most attentive. We waited a long time after asking for the bill, even though there were all but two other tables besides ours left dining. Eventually we all just went to the bar and found our server to pay him. \n","\n","Overall, an underwhelming experience. Small portions, slow service, copious use of oil in dishes, exorbitant prices, satisfactory but unremarkable food.\n","It was easy to make a reservation in English.  Why do I say this when I called during Dimsum time on a Friday afternoon?\n","I guess if you've tried to do this, you'll understand. but usually calling a Chinese restaurant for me at noon is tough. \n"," - They need to answer the phone first, \n"," - It's so noisy they usually can't hear you, \n"," - It's easier if you speak Chinese.  So when I called Fisherman's Terrace, I was really happy to find out that I could make the call for reservations at   on Saturday night.  No problem!! Wow! Done deal!\n","\n","Because of this I had a good feeling about dining out here for dinner.\n","I've always had Dim Sum here and have to say that the Dim Sum is great (Five stars BTW)!  Service is great and that's just what we got last night.   \n","Why only   stars then?  The big $$ food was great, but there were some other dishes we didn't know too much about and it was a bit of an experiment which didn't turn out so good for us.\n","We ordered a \n","-Cream corn soup with chicken - very good\n","-Crab with ginger and green onion - very tasty everyone loved this dish and finger licking good!\n","-Lobster in cream sauce - tasted more like cream of mushroom soup so we were not that impressed, but it was still very good.\n","-Abalone with fish maw- good, but my Granny didn't like it.  She said it didn't taste like west coast abalone, and true it wasn't.  Nobody liked the fish maw and so this dish for others wasn't as good as the first three.\n","-Chicken lettuce wrap. - Another hit!, but for me I could do with it being a bit less greasy.\n","-Chicken with pineapple and ginger - some liked it, some didn't.  It was a bit gingery, but for me this is ok.  I like ginger.\n","-Szechuan fish - hmmmm it wasn't at all what we thought it was going to be.  Chunks of fish ( a bit of bone in some) deep fried and then put into a hotpot with a spicy sweet sauce.  My aunt loved it. she ate it up. The rest of us just had a bit of it. so it was a kind-of-a-miss here.\n","-Mushrooms with fungus. - Not at all what we thought it was.  OK Mushrooms are fungus, but we thought it was going to be that black or white fungus you get with the mushrooms.  Instead it had lotus root and mushrooms.  Is lotus root a fungus?  I'll have to Google it later.\n","\n","The end of the meal had the red bean soup. Yuch!  so we asked for the Mango pudding.  This was very thick and heavy instead of the lighter fare we get at some other places.  A nice solid chunk of pudding!! Different but good.\n","Which reminding me of \"If you don't eat your meat! You can't have any pudding!  You can't have any pudding if you don't eat your meat!\"\n","\n","I think next time, when I dine with my family, we'll order what we know for sure they'll like and not experiment on the menu with something they're not too sure about.  Just the basics. Crab, lobster, fish, veggies with oyster sauce, and a few basic meat dishes.\n","This Chinese Seafood Restaurant in Richmond really does NOT need another review, especially from me, as most of the local Seafood lovers already know about this place very well. However, for new tourists, especially those who are staying in areas close to the airport might find our dining experience here useful. \n","\n","The spacious, comfy dining room is located on the   floor with ELEVATOR and stair access. All tables have table cloth. It offers excellent seafood dishes and has very attentive and friendly service. Yes, they serve wine and beers, too. \n","\n","OUR EXPERIENCE - Details you can skip:\n","\n","My wife and I are visiting Vancouver in late March and have cravings for King Crabs, which, lucky for us are still in season! During our PREVIOUS trip to Vancouver   ago, my wife and I had the FRESHEST tasting King Crab in Jade Seafood. We had  /  of a King Crab (~ ) steamed in famous Chinese \"huadiao\" wine! \n","\n","Yes, we know there are several other seafood restaurants around Jade Seafood, which are very popular for King Crabs, and their prices are actually cheaper than Jade Seafood. However, those popular ones are always crowded and have a long wait. We know, as we were in one of those restaurants a few yrs prior, and didn't think the lower price was worth it.  \n","\n","So, one evening on this Vancouver trip, we went right back to Jade Seafood, longing for another feast on scrumptious King Crabs! Well, guess what!? The luck was NOT on our side! They NO LONGER serve HALF CRAB, because all their stock was heavier than   lbs each, and targeted for parties of   or more! The friendly waiter and manager told us that NO WAY   of us was able to finish a   King Crab, no matter how hungry and inspired we thought we were! At $ /lb (BTW, at other restaurants, ~$ - /lb), they advised us to be STRONG and sensible and resist the temptation...! We could sense that the manager and the wait staff were truly feeling sorry for us! They said they appreciated our loyalty of coming back to them, and offered us a discounted price for a LOBSTER dish and a free veggie dish of our choice...! My wife was more disappointed than I was for not being able to sink our teeth into a King Crab that evening, but we finally came to our senses and decided to take up the manager's offer! To ease the pain, we ordered a bottle of Yellow Tail wine ($ , great restaurant price) right away. \n","\n","The rest of our meal consisted of a  +lb Lobster ($  per lb discounted price) in ginger and scallion over a bed of noodles, a free veggie dish (snow peapod leaves), very tasty razer clams in black bean sauce ($ ), and   scallops in garlic sauce and transparent noodles ($ \n","ea). Too much for two hungry people? - No, not too much for US TWO! We actually finished them all, including the ENTIRE BOTTLE of Yellow Tail AND a small bowl of rice to boot! They were all super delicious! \n","\n","We did have to take our sweet time stuffing ourselves, though. We got in around  , the place was almost full. It was almost  , when we asked for our bill. We were one of the last four tables of customers left. Our manager and wait staff came over and told us how impressed they were with our great appetite, BUT they STILL maintained that EVEN WE, could never have finished their   pounder King Crab by ourselves! \n","\n","In short, we had a great dining experience after all, even though we were disappointed for not being able to have our King Crab feast! We appreciated very much the manager's  honest, practical recommendations, discounts and the freebie veggie dish!\n","\n","In our next trip to Vancouver, we'll be back here for sure, along with a couple of NEW friends, for a  +lb King Carb! \n","\n","BTW: For tourists, the best way to get to restaurants in this area is by taxi, even though there's a Rail Stn nearby. Before leaving the restaurant, be sure to ask the host to CALL a taxi for you. \n","\n","Mar  \n","THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I AM IN AWE AT HOW TERRIBLE THIS EXPERIENCE WAS.\n","This was my second time here & I after today's experience, it will be my LAST. The lady server was unfriendly from the moment our group sat down (and it was only us   girls, a small quiet group). We decided to come here for a cheap yet tasty dinner. I ordered a small rare beef pho with beef balls with a side of a spring roll. When my order came, my pho was not steaming, as my friends bowls of pho were both steaming. That wasn't a major issue because it was still warm enough to enjoy. However, problems arose when   minutes later, my broth was basically cooled down & had not cooked my rare beef. I waved the waitress down & asked for my bowl to simply be reheated in the microwave so that my beef could cook. As an immunosuppressed consumer, this was not a thing of nit-pickiness, but a concern for my own health as well. All I asked was for my bowl to be reheated; I did not demand or ask for a replacement or a refund. I thought I was being quite simple about it. However, the waitress was clearly upset & proceeded to tell me that next time, I should order cooked beef. I asked her to repeat herself because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. She proceeded to tell me the same thing, only more aggressively before storming off to microwave my broth. BUT IT DOESN'T END HERE. \n","Not knowing that I was also vietnamese, she began to sh*t talk me in our language to her co-worker in the kitchen. After a couple minutes, she brought the bowl out to a male server and told him in vietnamese to \"throw in some hot water for that woman\". Finally, my bowl came, and it was hot enough to cook my beef this time. As my friends and I were finishing up our meal, the lady server glared at me whenever she had the chance to be facing me. In awe of this horrible experience, we were about to pack up when the man at the front desk rudely called out to us :\"You paying separate or together?\". We said separate, and right away he said: \"OK come here.\" He basically KICKED US OUT of their restaurant, and we were literally there for just under and hour.\n","My total came to $ . , but I didn't have a dime so I gave him $ .  because I thought the quarter would help because it was less change for him to give. Instead, he looked at me and said \"TEN, TEN CENTS\" & I told him I didn't have a dime. He slammed my quarter back down & just took the $ . The whole .  cents he gave back??? He slammed each coin down one by one. He even did that to my other   friends who paid by cash. Overall, I am super unimpressed. I know there isn't much to expect from asian restaurants, but this was the lowest of the low. The entire hour that we were in there eating was so uncomfortable! Just not how any restaurant should be. It's no wonder why it's been dead both times I've been here. Do yourself a favor & dine somewhere else.\n","So have you ever been to a place that was totally unexpected?\n","I mean in a good way.  You see, I am an old time Yelper, yes, that's me. I'm old and I've been doing Yelp in Vancouver since Yelp YVR was just getting it's teething done.  Yes, that goes way back to our very first Community Manager, Crystal.  A person I absolutely adore and think the world of.

In addition to the beef brisket, there was plenty of tendon and tripe which were swimming in the simple but flavourful broth.\n","\n","The Rabbit Coconut Cakes ($ . ) has a very subtle coconut flavour (which suited us just fine). Probably wouldn't order this again but it is a cute dish.\n","\n","The dessert that really impressed us was the Matcha Black Sesame Flowering Pear ($ . ) which had a warm black sesame filling that oozed out of the crisp skin when you bit into it. If you're gonna order a dessert dish here, make sure it's this one.\n","\n","Overall, most dishes here were pretty good. Well worth the visit just for the matcha black sesame pears.\n","Boastful name - but true HK BBQ mastery that lives up to the name and hype.  In my flights of fancy, I've always wanted to learn the old-school Southern Chinese cuisine dark arts... I think I want to apprentice here.\n","\n","My buddy wanted one last good Chinese meal before his flight out of YVR.  Needing a meal at fast-food pace, we stopped in.  Lo and behold - the place had all the hallmarks that promised epically good food.  Slaughtered and glistening animals on meathooks in the window.  Tiny floorspace with cramped seats.  Everything served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils.  Like any good Chinese chef worth their salt, huge forearms handling the cleavers.\n","\n","We arrived half-hour before closing time (  everyday - dark on Wednesdays) and the waitress said they only had roast pork left.  I was pretty disappointed as I wanted roast duck as well but knew this place was serious -- the demand is high and they don't make so much as to dare serve day-olds to clients (come early!).\n","\n","The roast pork was sensational - the perfect cut, not too fat and not too lean or dried out.  Expertly seasoned throughout and not oversalted at the tip.  And I haven't even gotten to the best part: the skin.  Ridiculously crispy - almost as if it was deep-fried separately and then reattached.  With crispiness like this, the chef must have surgeon-level flame control skills.  All over a bed of seasoned riced with a laughable sprig of broccoli - probably to offset the guilty of eating a plate of delicious animal fat and carbs.  Finally, the fragrant tea they serve is the perfect pairing to help you wash down the greasy goodness.\n","\n","What took this place over the top for me was the fact that after we settled the bill, five minutes before closing, the waitress topped off our tea again.  The service was an odd mix of brutal, cut-throat efficiency yet surprisingly attentive.  When a lonely, hungry patron wandered in (forgetting they were closing) and having no where to eat takeout, they allowed him to stay after closing when he promised to eat quickly.  We left the place with the kid hunched over his bounty and devouring his meal - the satisfied look on his face said it all.  The HK BBQ Master is a compassionate master.\n","\n","$ .  for a rice plate with your meat of choice - if available, there is all the items you would expect: roast pork, roast duck, BBQ pork, soya sauce chicken.  $  for two meats of your choosing in the same portion.  Or $ .  for three meats.  Taxes included.  Take-out by the pound and party platters available.\n","\n","If it wasn't too awkward to get pass airport security, my buddy would have taken some roast pork home as carry-on.  This was a 'bad last meal' in Vancouver for him - in that it was hard-hitting reminder of what he couldn't get in Edmonton.\n","\n","So why only   out of   stars?  I haven't had their roast duck yet, I will update when I have had it.  However, if this place is as good as I think it is, it would easily hit  -stars -- when that happens, expect me to be kneeling outside the restaurant until the HK BBQ Master accepts me as his pupil.\n","TL;DR - Just as I remember it in HK. A little pricey but food is good; portions are just right and it's in a very convenient location.  Great stop for lunch.\n","\n","---\n","\n","I first tried Pepper Lunch in HK back in   and I was so excited to hear that they opened up a legit location in Vancouver! I visited Vancouver back in May   and one of my first stops was in Richmond for lunch... to Pepper Lunch.  Parking is limited on No.   Rd... so you're either going to park on the street, at the mall/plaza and walk... or there's some underground parking behind the actual plaza.  It's free (for up to   hours I think?) so make sure to take advantage of that.  \n","\n","When you walk in, there's plenty of booth seating and the whole location probably seats more than  -ish people.  You first order from a menu on the wall and they assign you a seat with a number.  I came with my boyfriend and there was no line at all.  Probably only   or so people inside during lunch on a Thursday so I'm surprised it wasn't busier.  If I worked in the area, it's definitely a prime spot for me to grab a quick bite.  We got our order very quickly after sitting... probably less than a   mins wait (but hey! The food cooks in front of you so not much to wait for).\n","\n","Our order:\n","What they're known for, the Beef Pepper Rice  Combo - My boyfriend got the combo since it came with soup and refillable Coke.  The beef cooked really fast and there's plenty of rice and corn.  It's not small and he was full afterwards but it was his first time there and he wasn't ecstatic to come back.    \n","Japanese Hamburger - With corn/veges and no egg.  But it does come with rice in a bowl on the side (not pictured).  I found that the beef cooked faster than I would've liked so perhaps I didn't turn it over quick enough.  The butter on top melted almost instantaneously after I took this photo.  Very good burger nonetheless though.  Very crumbly which is fine but flavorful and very peppery.  \n","\n","Overall we paid about $  (before tax and tip) and I think that's a little expensive for what it is.  You can go to Aberdeen and there's a restaurant in the food court that serves something similar for a fraction of the price.  However, Pepper Lunch does offer service and it was average (not spectacular).   You have to call over the wait staff to get more Coke or water which I thought was a nuisance but the guy at the front was very patient with us as we humm-ed and haa-ed over the menu for   minutes.  Other than that, I thought the food was very close to what I remember in HK (both in portions, taste and interactive-ness).  You can't really miss it up and the experience of cooking your own food is always fun.  The price is only thing I'm wary about but I would definitely come again for lunch if I wanted something more filling.\n","HORRIBLE service. I never write reviews and bad service really doesn't bother me that much as long as the food is good, but my god, I felt compelled to make an account AS I am eating the chicken because in my   years of life I have never seen someone treat a paying customer like this, and I am completely in shock. This is coming from a Chinese person who frequents Hong Kong style cafes, and for those who don't know what I am talking about, let's just say those kinds of cafe are notorious for how rude their staff are.\n","\n","So the chicken is stored in this glass, heated case. No one came to greet us at the counter or anything, which is completely fine - this seems like a self-service kind of thing and the glass says something like \"take and pay at counter\". While we are still browsing the different flavours, a staff member quickly brushes us aside from the glass case to pop a freshly made batch in. This already felt a bit rude since she kinda just shoved us aside, but we didn't think too much of it. There is a counter next to the glass case, so naturally, we think this is where we pay. We stand at the counter, and the same woman, in a very annoyed tone, points to a different cashier across from the BBQ Chicken counter and just repeats \"cashier, cashier!\" Maybe she doesn't speak English, I don't know, but even in her face, she looked so annoyed that people dared to try and take chicken out of this box and pay for it here. Under the giant glowing sign that says BBQ Chicken. It was just bizarre. \n","\n","Her \"work\"  was really strange, too, like the area was quite empty at this time, to be honest, but she just kept dashing around the kitchen like she's in a real rush to get more chicken into the box when there was already way more chicken than customers coming in.\n","\n","Anyway, we find where to pay, and I will also say the cashier where we paid was also MISERABLY rude, but I guess she's not part of this business, it's just where we pay...? I'm really not sure, but I won't go in on her here. We pay the miserable lady, we sit down, and then my friend goes up to the BBQ Counter once again to ask if they have napkins. The chicken lady just says \"no\" rudely and again points elsewhere where we can get napkins.\n","\n","I am just so shocked at how rude they were for absolutely no reason. I told my friend after we sat down \"it feels like we're begging for food\" and I'm pretty sure even people feeding the homeless are much kinder to their patrons than these people are to paying customers here. \n","\n","I'm giving this   stars because the chicken was not bad. It's crispy on the outside and (the one we got) had a sweet and spicy sauce over it, while the inside is still really juicy and tender.\n","\n","It's just the service that deserves all the other stars to be removed. Whoever owns this joint, if you ever see this, I really beg you to look into your staff, maybe give them some basic etiquette lessons or something so they don't treat customers like crap.\n","Ah, the Beaver.  Big part of my growing up.\n","\n","I can't remember how I first heard of this place, but it has never disappointed.  Many a Wednesday evening has been wasted here.\n","\n","Parking is ample.. in a lot across the road @ Harbour Air.  If you want one of the spots in the lot directly in front, you really do have to get lucky.  However, if you ride a motorcycle..\n","\n","As I'm not a hockey fan (unless you count cheering for whoever happens to be playing), I try to avoid game nights if I can.  This place gets packed with Canucks fanboys/fangirls.  There's also an outdoor heated (but not covered) patio, for those summer nights.\n","\n","On game nights, they have this contest (other places have it too but thought I'd mention) where you draw a card with a Canuck's number, and if he scores, you get a drink.  The kicker is that if you draw a goalie and he has a shutout for the period, that counts a \"score\" for the goalie.  Now I may be no hockey expert but something tells me the goalie cards give you the best odds of scoring free drinks. *wink*\n","\n","For a date it's not bad, but a bit loud.  Trust me, I've tried, and it wasn't even a game night.\n","\n","Now onto the food.\n","\n","The beaver's claim to fame.  WINGS (Wednesdays and Sundays).  There are   flavours.  Pints of Honey Brown are also $ .  on this day.  The wings are   each.  My rankings:\n","\n"," ) Thai Chili - pure crack.  I can eat this all day.  Sweet with a spicy kick. My favourite!\n"," ) Salt + Pepper - covered with rock salt + pepper, but otherwise plain (ie no sauce).  Actually one of the better tasting ones, as you can also easily rub off some of the salt to suit your taste.  I like rock salt for some stupid reason.\n"," ) Honey Garlic - very delicious and you can actually taste the honey.  Another staple, but very similar wings can be had elsewhere.\n"," ) Hot - this one has just the right amount of spiciness in my opinion.  However, you do not want to get a dozen of just this type.\n"," ) BBQ - this one tastes like BBQ sauce.  Maybe I'm thinking more of bbqed wings when I eat this one, but I find it rather disappointing.\n"," ) Teriyaki - imo the worst one.  Are they buying this sauce from a factory in Prince George or something?\n","\n","Mondays - Burger Night\n","You can't go wrong with this burger either.  Also served with salad and fries, for a reasonable price.  But it's nothing special.\n","\n","Tuesdays - Fish & Chips\n","They serve it in this Chinese-style basket (think dim sum), with \"salad\" (really just a pile of shredded lettuce, see pic).  The pieces are a bit smaller than some other places but it's not bad.  Fries are a bit on the soggy side, and tartar sauce is a bit too salty.  Maybe it's just done differently.  My only complaint is that I left hungry.  The drink special is pale ale.\n","\n","Thursdays - Steak Night\n","For some $ , you can get a decent steak made to order, coleslaw, and skewer with   shrimp.  This is actually pretty tasty.  My only complaint is that I have to swing by McDonald's after leaving.  It's not the biggest steak.\n","\n","All in all, a great place to sit back, get some decent pub food, and grab a drink all while watching the occasional seaplane takeoff/land.  There is ALWAYS a drink special (except for maybe Fridays but I could be wrong), and the prices aren't bad at all.\n","\n","Recommended.\n","Big Chef Restaurant located in Richmond, BC on \"Eatery Street\" near the end of Alexandra Road is a recently opened Chinese restaurant offering speciality dishes, seafood, and hot pot. Although there are plenty of restaurants in this busy-parking-limited plaza; such as Deer Garden Signatures, Michigan Noodle Restaurant, Cattle Cafe, Big Chef offers quality ingredients.\n","\n","   \n","The restaurant is bring, clean and roomy. Aside from the main dining area there are also   private rooms available; booth seats line the right side and large round tables fill the remaining spaces. Service is friendly and the staff is eager to make recommendations.\n","\n","Golden Live Crab (seasonal price + $ )\n","\n","Persevered salty duck egg yolks stir fried crab with sticky cake (). Golden egg yolk robes the crab and serenates with the sticky rice in medley of fragrant, crispy coating. The freshness of the crab is not overpowered by this otherwise heavy dish. It is not as oily as one would presume. The little dried shrimp seasoned with the egg yolk adds great bite. For the health cautious - this dish is rather high in cholesterol due to the amount of yolk required to compose this dish. Nothing a few laps in the pool won't negate! Definitely a must try! Another recommendation was the \"spicy salt / pepper\" rendition. This was actually one of the last dish to arrive. Guess it takes more time to prep.\n","\n","Hotos Rhizome and Mushroom with Beef Tenderloin $ . \n","Lotus roots, pineapple, green/red peppers stir fried beef tenderloin cubes. Beef is tender and cooked perfectly. Lotus roots is crispy, pineapple is sweet yet slightly tart and adds texture to this dish. Stir fried together in a black pepper like sauce in perfection.\n","\n","Salty Baked Chicken  . \n"," \n","One of their specialty dishes. Initially we wanted to order the Hot Pot Soya Sauce Chicken but we didn't know that this needs to be ordered in advance. The waiter recommended this in replacement. Deliciously silky tender and juicy steamed to cook served with sand ginger  oil sauce.\n","\n","Pan Fried Pork Jowl with Red Bean Sauce $ . \n","\n","Red fermented bean curd flavour is salty with mild sweetness dressing the pork jowl slices in a smooth velvety cream like blanket. Stir fried together with lotus root slices gives a fresh lightness to this dish. Lotus roots are crunchy and pork jowl are tender.\n","\n","Fried Scallop with Walnut Prawns  . \n","\n","One of the last dish to arrive of the night was a nice surprise when we discovered the scallops were perfectly deep fried - not over cooked but thoroughly juicy and tender. The prawns were big and elastic in every bite sauteed over a creamy salad dressing sauce. The only catch was, what happened to the walnuts?\n","\n","Dessert was complimentary red bean soup; common to most Chinese restaurants. This however was the disappointment of the night. This dessert soup was watery (it was like they were running low on supply and mixed hot water in) and overpowered by the dried mandarin orange peels. At least we now had an excuse to go grab cheesecake at Cafe de Waraku   (click here).\n","\n","At the end of the night, we were well fed and satisfied. Perhaps the food could have came a little quicker but $  before tips for a party of   is pretty darn reasonable and perhaps cheaper than some boutique places that also offers similar selection. I'm already thinking of my next visit!\n","Red Bud (post  )\n","\n","Why post  ? For years, this was the go to HK cafe in Richmond for me. Yes, iCafe was always around, but being that it's much further away for us, this place was it. Always consistent, never sub par; the old Red Bud was a solid   star, HK style cafe that was convenient (even accepted debit.  .  star,  . /  for years, the main knock being that the menu focused so much on lobster and steak meals to the detriment of their Catonese selection... Western HK cafe stuff was good, but not enough Canto dishes)\n","\n","Then about a year ago they closed for renovations, and upon reopening? All new staff, ownership, and management. And despite leaving the Interac sign in front, argued with me that they were now cash only. I was unimpressed, so hadn't been back in a year.\n","\n","If you're curious, the entire staff of the old Red Bud ended up opening another HK cafe calles \"Hong Kong Flavour Restauarant\" and it's pretty much as good as it was before, but now much farther away.\n","\n","The first visit at \"New Red Bud\" after the ownership Change, the food was nearly identical despite the complete staff change, except the borscht was less flavourful,  thinner.\n","\n","Well, a year on? The borscht is even weaker now; for all intents and purposes it's vegetable soup, with a *lot* of large potato chunks. Not bad per se, but not authentic HK style borscht.  . - .   stars. Fortunately, the nice accompanying garlic toast remains unchanged.\n","\n","Then my mix and match grill arrived (chicken steak, deep fried pork chop). The cook on both meats was almost *perfect*, and the quality of both meats was high (but not gristle/fat free -- fortunately, there was very little). Almost: the last   bites of chicken had a little unrendered fat under the skin; not enough to significantly lower the score though. The fries are the same as iCafe (and Costco); the deliciously double-fried variety. The black pepper sauce is very good, if lacking a little kick.\n"," .  stars.\n","\n","And the iced tea is delicious. Exactly what I crave when I'm in Hong Kong, and what I lament not being able to find any of in Japan (no seriously, I go into HK iced tea withdrawls there).\n","\n","Do I miss the old Red Bud? The \"Cheers\" of HK style cafes, where everyone did know your name: the low prices, pretty high quality, central location and convenience of debit brought many repeat customers. The staff used to know my name, but so did many of the patrons: friends of my parents who had watched me grow up, local customers who are used to seeing me around town for decades.\n","\n","I do miss that, and walked in here fully expecting to write a less positive review, but I can't. Even the service is pretty good, even if they don't know my name.\n","\n","Oh, and although they scratched out the Interac sign in front, they've gone back to accepting debit. \n","\n","Still pretty good, even if the soup isn't  . / ,  .  stars\n","Yet another stop on my great BC adventure! Pops wanted to get steak at some point on the trip so I used the handy dandy Yelp app's search feature to find a steak spot just down the street. The reviews were pretty good and it was open late enough to accommodate our noshing needs. I used Open Table to snag a reservation (which wasn't needed) and we were ready for burnt cow. \n","The outside of Chop is impressive! Very cool store front. There is Chop the restaurant and on just the other side of their courtyard there is Chop the lounge. I found this to be a really cool concept. Keep the people out for a nice dinner separate from the people looking for HH munchings and crunchings with their booze-type libations. \n","I was famished and almost devoured my father's arm on the ride to Chop so after the nice ladies working the front desk confirmed our reservation and took us to our table I instantly started checking out the appetizers. I needed something quickly or I would start chewing on the upholstery so I ordered us the steakhouse cheese bread with artisan cheeses. It was cheese bread. Maybe the cheeses were artisan... maybe they worked down the street sketching tourists' caricatures... I'm not judging how the cheeses made their living. It was cheese bread. Quickly eaten and forgotten. I thank the cheese bread for keeping me from losing my mind but in the end... it was cheese bread. \n","From there I ordered the stuffed Gorgonzola fillet with wasabi mashed potatoes. The steak was just a little undercooked for me but it was still great and seasoned well. As I'm often heard saying in regards to cheese... I could have done with more cheese stuffed into my steak but it was really good. I could have eaten  ... well...   of this steak easily. The wasabi mashed potatoes weren't as spicy as I was hoping but that's usually how things go when it comes to spicy. I do have to say that the wasabi flavor was really tasty in the mashed potatoes. More places should offer this as an option. All in all both my fillet and the side were delicious and quickly found themselves making like a magician and disappearing. \n","I know what you're thinking... no meal is complete without dessert and I completely agree. Our server kindly brought over some dessert menus and took our orders for various espresso drinks. My Americano was made quite well and did the trick. I felt caffeinated and ready for the rest of the night. I ordered the fallen chocolate souffle that came with a mascarpone mousse and vanilla anglaise. Dude! That anglaise was DA BOMB! I may have gotten some looks as I licked it off my plate... around the cake 'cause I hadn't even started on that yet. Screw them for judging me with their eyes! The dessert was rich and delicious as nearly all things chocolate are. Out of my typical character I shared one small bite with my dad so he could try it... and then threatened his life if he went for another bite. He concurred that this was a beastly delicious dessert and was well worth it. \n","From the reservations, the greeting, ordering, eating and paying before leaving this entire dining experience was what they should all be at their best. Simple, pain free and memorably yummy. I'll remember Chop when people mention coming to Richmond and if I have to pass through again I'll definitely try to make a stop here.\n","I'm a fan!\n","Exec summary: Good location and view, below average service, good menu, not so great fish, fail on the details.\n","\n","After reading several reviews of other Yelp members I can't help to think they are delirious with food comatose.  Today's visit was a result of another local fish and chips staple being closed. We winged it and decided on the Charthouse with a recommendation from a passer by as we perused the menu. \n","\n","The menu is very dynamic and offers a good lunch variety and pricing. Their specials seem like good deals. After settling in we ordered (  of us) the calamari with tziziki. The quantity of the platter was good and so was the thickness of the calamari, however it was a bit too chewy. The breading was good and seasoned well. \n","\n","Next we had a round of chowders.   Manhattan (red) and   Boston's please. They were good and did not last long. My Boston had a very good creamy consistency and flavor. There were chunks of some veggies and potatoes but not chunky or meaty enough.  Sadly to say this restaurant doesn't offer oyster crackers and I fear it's a detail lost to cost effectiveness. \n","\n","My cousin and I ordered their special and cod fish and chips to share. That way we can get a good sample of their cuisine.  The special was a puff pastry stuffed with cheese, a white wine sauce, and various shellfish.  When it came out, presentation was very nice and it looked very yummy.  We split that bad boy up and I went to work!  After taking my first bite, the cheese overpowers everything.  I couldn't taste any of the so called white wine.  Time to grab some peppa to flavor this up a bit.  So I grab the shaker and dab a bit on the dish and out comes salt.  WTF!  I double check and make sure I grabbed the right shaker and yes I did.  This ended up posing a discussion at the table that I will get into later.  Back to the food!\n","\n","The cod was a very generous portion.  On the menu they offer a single and double.  The price was good for the double and fearing not having enough fish to share with my cousin we ordered the double.  Turns out it was more than enough.  The one piece was nearly   inches long or  .  cm for most of you reading this.  After getting into the fish I found that it was a bit soggy.  Seemed as if it had been sitting under a lamp and softened up.  I had to try my fries and the same result.  They had a sitting out on a lamp consistency to them.  I attacked the smaller ones since they seemed to stay crisper.  Also on the plate was coleslaw, which I avoided since my other cousin's wife found hair in hers.  Chances for coleslaw contamination: HIGH!\n","\n","Cross border attack!  My other cousin ordered the seafood souvlaki and it was a skewer of salmon and halibut that was grilled... souvlaki style.  The plate came with traditional fixins of pita bread, rice, veggies and tziziki.  I got a taste of the salmon and halibut and it wasn't dry, wasn't overcooked and had some good flavouring.  I just find it an odd dish.  Non the less if you like souvlaki and fish you will most likely enjoy this dish.\n","\n","So the best part of the meal was... the BEER!  A local pale ale.  The worst part of the meal, was the stomach aches we all had ranging from   minutes after ingestion to   hour.  I have a strong stomach and mine didn't start making digestion beats until about an hour later.  My cousin's wife had an immediate stomach ache and so did my cousins.  Looking back at the meal I'm suspecting the restaurant appears to be on the ropes of hanging on and are cutting corners to save money.  The fry oil was probably old and attributed to the general problems of the food.  Missing oyster crackers, restroom that looks as if it wasn't wiped down since they opened, and general malaise of the staff and lack of enthusiasm (see upcoming paragraph).\n","\n","Salt vs Pepper.  Most S&P shakers have different hole patterns to allow a certain amount of the substance out, in measured portions.  If you have a tiny salt grain in a pepper shaker that has   holes, you are going to salt yourself to death.  This restaurant had the salt in the pepper shaker and pepper in the salt shaker.  So I asked the table what was right and wrong for the purpose of debate.  My cousin's from Israel claim that the one with multiple holes is for salt because it's humid where they live and the moisture gets into the salt shaker which can block some of the holes.  So you need more holes to have a better chance of getting salt out of the shaker.  I claimed that it was a sign of laziness and they should clean the shakers more often. So the waiter approaches just after we finished talking about it and had this exchange:\n","Me \"Which one is salt and which one is pepper?\"\n","Waiter [picks up one of the shakers and dabs some on his palm]\n","Waiter \"This is salt.\"\n","Me \"How am I supposed to tell without doing that?\"\n","Waiter [walks away]\n","Me [looking at my cousins now...]\n","Me \"WTF was that?\"\n","\n","Allan B.\n","This place is ridiculous. The most awful, insincere, unorganized, and unprofessional restaurant to consider themselves fine dining. \n","\n","Usually I hold Asian restaurant service to a lower standard--especially if it is a hole in the wall type of restaurant. This is not that type of restaurant. Dishes are an average of $  & up. Which isn't a huge deal if it were seafood or if this wasn't typical Chinese fare you could get cheaper elsewhere. \n","\n","My group of   were seated almost within minutes around late   on a Friday night. That was probably the only highlight of the night.  This was our second and final night in Vancouver, so had been trying to fit all the food we could fit in our stomachs since   (no lie!) We had heard about their XLB, so we wanted to try a couple dishes--even though we weren't starving. \n","\n","We placed   orders: steamed fish, taro crusted duck, fried rice cakes, bean curd wrapped mushrooms, and steamed pork buns. Our waitress took our order and made a snide comment, \"Right now you only have   dishes. That's not enough for you. You NEED to order more.\" Who is our waitress, that she feels entitled to tell us how much we should be ordering?! My family then opted for a hot and sour soup. Our waitress then comes back and tells us that they sold out of their steamed pork buns. Perfect, as if we aren't already irked. So we decided to try   orders of their XLB. \n","\n","Our food arrived promptly. First up was the hot & sour soup. Usually at Chinese restaurants, the waiter divvies up the soup for us into bowls on the lazy Susan. Nope, the manager stands there and stares at us while my family struggles to serve ourselves. Then he finally offers to assist us. Then the rest of our food arrives...everything except the fish. The food was mediocre at best. For $  a dish, we expected more. The taro crusted duck was mostly taro with the essence of some sort of duck taste. The rice cakes were overcooked and slightly mushy. The bean curd wrapped mushrooms and XLB were typical and nothing special. Let's just say that at this point we are nothing short of happy nor are we satisfied. Our waitress came by to ask if we wanted to order more because it was the last call before their kitchen closed. We decided we were fine with the food we had. \n","\n","We were slowing down on our meal and we're still waiting for our fish. A waiter--who, keep in mind was not our waitress--just drops our check off at the table. How completely unprofessional to ask us to pay before we had even completed our meal--let alone not all of our food had arrived yet. We asked for the manager and told him that it was completely unprofessional--including our waitress' prior remark. He apologized, walked away with the check, and publicly asked his service staff who was responsible. The young man admitted to it and the manager openly criticized him. This business is just unprofessional on top of unprofessional. \n","\n","We wait a couple minutes and observe the manager and waitstaff--unorganized chaos. We finally just tell him that we don't want our fish anymore. More minutes pass. The manager comes over and asks if we have our check back. We don't have it. He grabs it, hands it to us, and we open it to find that the check is unadjusted. He returns it to us and he seems to only know the words \"sorry\"--completely superficial. To top the icing on the cake, another waitress starts to clear off our table when we haven't finished eating yet. She hadn't even asked us. Talk about in a hurry to close the damn restaurant. Customers should not be rushed out of a restaurant especially when there are still so many people dining. \n","\n","Oh also, if you are a server and a table has upset you, maybe you shouldn't be talking about us in clear view. Just a couple points about professionalism. I would recommend steering clear of this restaurant that is UNDOUBTEDLY not customer-oriented.\n","We were trying to decide where to eat for a lovely date tonight. I suggested we go to Steveston Village because it's always so calm and peaceful there. I had a craving for seafood (especially fish), so we browsed through Steveston seafood restaurants on Opentable. Steveston Seafood House had many great reviews on there, so I booked it. Also, Lauren L. gave this place a fantastic review on Yelp, so that's why I was more inclined to eat here -- she is one of my favorite Richmond Yelpers.\n","\n","I notice that Linda Y's review from August   saying the staff do not wear masks. When we arrived, the staff were wearing shield masks, so they must have adjusted to that. I actually would like to get the same mask for myself, it seems like it would be a lot more breathable and I like that I can see a person's face and expression under that. I forgot to ask the staff where they get those. So for those who are worried about Covid- , please be rest assured that the staff are wearing masks.\n","\n","There were hand sanitizer and cleaning agents on another table, but I had my own hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes with me so I didn't need to use them. My friends told me that they try to go to restaurants that offer menus online (so they don't have to touch menus that the rest of the public touched). I had forgotten to ask the restaurant this and they gave us physical menus to browse through. My suggestion is have an online menu, or just mention to guests that the menus are wiped down each time (I hope they are!) I used my hand sanitizer after using their menus.\n","\n","The tables were spaced very far apart, so social distancing was in effect here. Our hostess/server was very warm, nice and friendly. The seafood chowder was so delicious. I highly recommend that as one of the appetizers. We had two salmon platters (one was a special and the other was from the regular menu). Being an artist, what struck me was how colorful the plate looked with different foods. Someone from the kitchen had put thought into how the dishes would look with certain vegetables and rice. I loved the splashes of red, yellow, green and orange. The entree was generous too, I could not finish my dinner. I had to bring it home and eat the other half (as a matter of fact, I'm eating it now as I'm typing this review up). I wanted to try their desserts but I was just too full eating the dinner. So many restaurants I have eaten at served bland fish, but here, the salmon was so tasty. There were some type of seasoning on it, very subtle but still so good. It had the slightest subtle hint of India to me when I ate it, I don't know how to explain. But still a very Westcoast style and flavor fish. The vegetables were fresh and not soggy nor overdone, they were just perfect. \n","\n","Food and service was excellent at   stars, interior around  .  stars (lovely but felt a little lacking -- as if it were missing something), and the view maybe a   (an ocean view would have been a big plus). I give this venue overall a   star rating and highly recommend it for seafood and fish lovers.\n","I'm no hot pot expert by any means. Honestly, before yesterday, I didn't even like hot pot. Zi Y, who is a hot pot afficiando took me here and I'm not going to lie HaiDiLao changed my life. I will never look at another hot pot restaurant the same way. \n","\n","Brace yourselves, because this review is going to be a long one. There is just SO. MUCH. to talk about. \n","\n"," . I received the best service EVER at HaiDiLao. From beginning to end, the service is top tier. While you're waiting to be sat in the waiting room, they serve up an assortment of drinks, plus popcorn and other snacks. They also have tables set up and board games so you can entertain yourselves and be social with those around you while you wait. While we were waiting we got to choose what we wanted in our hot pot from an iPad so that by the time we got sat the food would be there already. The hostess led us to our table and explained everything throughly (since it was my first hot pot experience in   years). He introduced our server, Eliza, to us and she took care of us from there on out. She made sure that we understood how the sauces (build your own sauce bar...amazing), gave us hair ties to put our hair up, and aprons to make sure we didn't get our clothes dirty. She also took our jackets and put them in the storage underneath our table. Wow. The food all came out very quickly and she made sure to explain every single dish that we got. My water glass was never empty which was also another plus. Like I said, from start to finish, the service blew me away. Eliza even met us at the door to say goodbye to us and thank us for coming. GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE! \n","\n"," . The best part: the food. Wow. We did the  -soup pot but only got   soups: the tomato base, pork broth, and the spicy broth. All of them were great but my favourite was the tomato base. We ordered an assortment of ingredients to put in our hot pot: spicy beef, beef strips, fish balls (w/ crab filling), shrimp paste, cow stomach (my least favourite), fried pork. Honestly, besides the cow stomach, I was impressed with everything I tried. We also were able to create our own sauces at the sauce bar. I love DIY activities, so for me this was really exciting. You can create one of their pre-made sauces or create one of your own. I created one of their pre-made ones (seafood sauce) and then created one of my own (thai sweet chili sort of sauce). Eliza also brought over a sauce that she thought would pair nicely with the seafood we got. She was right. It was great.  \n","\n"," . They really try to make your experience an amazing one. If you call ahead and say you're coming in for a birthday, they'll create a special dessert dish for you and come out and sing with a light up birthday sign and all. If you tell them you're coming in for an anniversary, they decorate your table with flowers and such and also give you a little gift at the end. \n","\n"," . Their wait times are long yes, but just goes to show how popular their restaurant is. I'd suggest making a reservation a few days beforehand - you'll probably still have to wait a little bit when you get there. Entertain yourself with some snacks and games though. \n","\n"," . HaiDiLao is all about providing a fantastic experience. Whether that be from the food, to the service, to the entertainment. When we were here there was a Chinese dancer who performed. If you order the noodles as part of your hot pot, they'll even have someone come to your table to stretch out the noodles and put on a show. Hard to explain, you just need to come here and see if yourself.\n","\n","Wow. Impressed is an understatement. I will be back to bring all my friends and family. Thank you for an amazing (pretty much) first time hot pot experience, HaiDiLao.\n","NOTE Addendum:  I have added another review to the bottom of this one as I just came back from trying another bowl of Ramen. This time the Vegetable Ramen. See near bottom of review.\n","  Review:\n","This is the newest ramen shop to open in Richmond and a very welcome addition to the South East end of this town.  We had heard from other Yelper friends and colleagues that this place was pretty good.  So we had to come.  I didn't bring our Japanese Food Critique with me on this trip, but brought some other ramen lover  friends with me. Each of us ordered different soup bases.  I ordered the Chicken base Mayu Ramen and a side of Gyoza and Chicken Karaage.  The latter was very very good. Nicely seasoned and marinated pieces of crispy outside, moist and juicy pieces of meat tenderly fried with love.\n","The Gyoza was decent. I'd give it a just above average rating.  It was quite a good accompaniment for the Ramen which came next.\n","\n","The Mayu Ramen. I have to admit, I was surprised.  The boldness of the flavours all in one bowl!  My goodness!  Yes. I was surprised.  The noodles were nicely done, and the toppings were just the right proportions.  \n","The BBQ pork slices were a bit on the fatty side, I'm not sure if you can order it with less fat.  However, it was tender and tasty.  (just for me being an above \"middle-lifer\"... I have to reduce the fat and the salt intake.... Doctors orders.)\n","\n","Now having said that. There was something that ALL of us noticed.  The soups were rather on the salty side.  I know that Japanese tend to like their salt....just ask my mom or family. They'll put salt on their rice before tasting it. \n","\n","BUT HOLD A MINUTE!!  There is something I didn't say.  This dish, had GARLIC! Nice roasted garlic chunks that gave this soup a boldness over and above the Mayu flavour that made my tastebuds do a break dance!  I was making faces more orgasmic than Mark Wiens (food vlogger on YouTube) after trying out the best dish in the world.\n","\n","This means, there is some inventiveness put into their food.  They've researched, and come out with the right location and know what was needed in this area.  People will find this place and word of mouth and Yelp will help.\n","\n","I'll have to come back and get more on the history of this place and post it later in another review.\n","\n","Regardless of that fact.  This place is good enough for me to recommend it to our staff and host a company lunch there.\n","\n","So I am happy to say \"Welcome to the Hood!\"\n","\n","  Review:\n","OK So this time I came with my Japanese Food Critique or the JFC as some of you know her as here on Yelp.\n","We found out that the chef is a Japanese sushi chef!  The owners are Korean with lots of good fresh ideas behind this business.  You can tell that they're a young group with the media presentation and the website.\n","\n","Yaya had tried the Miso Ramen, her favourite and it's the one traditional Ramen dish that she knows well.  So she was a bit more critical of the soup.  She did however give it a   stars in the end know that she has an understanding of the style and how the Ramen dish came to be.  This Ramen soup uses the white miso, not the red or combination of both.\n","This is why, if you taste this dish, you'll find it a bit sweeter than others that serve Miso Ramen.  The other big difference is that you can order it in the Tonkotsu broth, or the Chicken broth.  I think you can even order it with the Vegetable broth too.  I would choose the latter for health reasons.\n","\n","I had to try the Vegetable Ramen with Vegetable broth as I and others have found the Tonkotsu and the Chicken broth too salty.  So I was a bit worried that this too would be too salty.  \n","When the soup came out, it didn't have a clear broth, but it was a bit creamy in colour. Once I had a taste, I knew that it was Sesame.  They used Goma () Sesame which gave it that lighter, cloudy colour.  I really liked it.  Much better than the other broths.  And when I added the fried garlic to the dish, it was even better.\n","Although this dish wasn't as salty as the others, it was still a bit salty.  So I'm hoping that they'll be able to revise their dishes a bit to make them less salty.\n","\n","\n","Decoration, design, atmosphere -  .  stars\n","Karaage -   stars\n","Gyoza -  .  stars\n","Mayu Ramen -   stars. - too salty, need to work on that. but flavourful\n","Vegetable Ramen - The best of the bunch that I have sampled so far.

I couldn't concentrate just thinking about that garlic.\n","I have noticed this joint but never bothered to try it as it was mostly empty even during busy times so I thought to myself that it mustn't be any good!\n","\n","So about a month ago, Deer Garden (see my reviews about them) was fully packed, so I strolled over and saw it was fairly full. I guess the place must have been improved, plus I like ramen so I gave it a try!\n","\n","Now I have eaten there   times (I rarely write reviews if I have only gone once, as it could be bad / good as a fluke), and I think they are worth more visits, plus a review too.\n","\n","I had tried tonkatsu ramen, miso ramen with butter, katsu-don, pork bone in hot pot set. Overall, all of them are pretty good. I actually like the not so salty tonkatsu soup, as I can taste the pork bone marrow in it. Of course the soup at Santouku is very flavourful but it's almost artificial as it has some fragrance in it, so it was hard to taste the pork bone marrow. I guess different people would prefer different style.\n","\n","The noodle is not as with a bite as the one at Nan-Chuu, but the rest wins Nan-Chuu though. The pork slices are just right, and the rest are good too.\n","\n","The katsu-don comes w/ some sides: miso soup, and a half marinated egg with running yolk, green soybean pods, and pickle (Japanese style). It was a large bowl and very filling. I rate it a better deal and value over the ramen (but ramen has been the fad in east Asia lately so that \"value\" is high of course).\n","\n","The pork bone in hot pot is interesting. I never had it at any Japanese restaurant so I can't even say if it's authentic. I know some Taiwanese places have mini hot pot set just like this, so this is similar more to that than any Japanese dishes I know of. But anyway, it was not bad, quite home made style. Of course awkward to \"play\" with the bone to get to the meat, so definitely it's a cultural thing (plus whom you are with).\n","\n","Last time I also ordered a fried potato mashes. I was told there were two kinds so I just picked one of them. When the order arrived, it had only   pieces, so I wondered why the value on izakaya was so bad at this place while staple food was so good. I asked the waitress and she said they mistakenly made a mini order, and my regular order should have   pieces. So later we got a   pieces order (so we got a freebie one!). The interesting part is that the sauce is not the same on them. The first order only had some white (mayo?) on it, but the   order had both white and dark one running across the top. I wonder why the treatment would be different too, even though it was a \"mistake\" order, but we didn't bother to find out. It is $ .  so definitely not cheap (but expected).\n","\n","The taste is ok. I was hoping for the kind of potato mash fried like what I had before, with minced meat and very flavourful. In a flat round shape, and not this long (rugby) shape.\n","\n","Service has been quite nice, and I'm surprised as usually Chinese run shops are that consistent (I'm one of them, I know!). Polite and friendly. They also come to pour tea from time to time, unlike some places (like Golden Bauhinia that I just reviewed, you never got more tea unless you find someone to ask). Sometimes they are full and customer has to wait a bit, but still they didn't ignore you.\n","\n","As far as small restaurants go, this one really surprises me. I never expected the food nor the service to be at this level. I thought it was just going to be yet another so called Japanese restaurant, especially Chinese run. Yes, I am surprised. The service is even better than the Sushi House, which is Japanese run (and within the same mall). Sometimes even at Kiyo I got bad service and they are expensive!\n","\n","One thing about the menu: if you follow the picture and thought the item listed next to it must be the one, then you are wrong. My dining companion (an elderly man) did exactly that, and ordered something else he thought was on the picture. I hope they put pictures on a separate page with the item listed next to the picture also.\n","\n","You just never know from guessing. So I echoed with Joann L this sentiment. I hope they keep it up.\n","I came here with significant other and brother in tow as someone still needed grub after a certain event. I had the luxury of having dinner at the main restaurant next door just a few days ago, and we needed something light and clean, so why not, as I thought it was actually the same kitchen that was connecting the two restaurants. We came here on a Thursday night, and it was fairly busy at about   pm. We were seated near the back where the kitchen was, and all you could smell in here was good aromas of Chinese food, which now was the hard part on what to order?\n","\n","The menu is quite vast, if you are here wanting the normal, as per the name of 'wonton noodle' you would expect the normal fare of noodle soups, dumplings, fried rice and roast meats on white rice, and congee's but if you are wanting more, you are definitely in luck, while not as luxurious as next door, this menu has some things that next door has. Some specialty dishes that we saw on this night were chicken hot pot dishes, fresh shellfish being 'wok'd' up to the table and observing the menu they do set meals, some that have the $$$ stuff, like abalone and... did I see the fin.... I'll get back to you on that.\n","\n","So since I did eat the parent restaurant a few nights ago... and snapped up pictures, there was a dish I wanted, which unfortunately they did not.. but the waitress tried her best with my picture on my phone and even showed it to the chef in the back of the kitchen, we did in turn have an order of their dumplings and a vermicelli dish with duck. There was another order that was placed, but in the end... and yes, it was a chicken hot pot dish.. was not put in, and good thing, as we were stuffed by the time the meal was done.\n","\n","The dumplings were good, a place that doesn't over-shrimp things, as my brother is not the biggest fan of these bottom feeders, each was plump and meaty, with no breakage of skin, presented in a nice big bowl, each had a good bite, and had a nice balance of mushroom and wood ears, no dipping sauce needed, unless you like vinegar! Our bowl of vermicelli in house broth came and a plate of seasoned duck, the meat on the duck was nice and firm, presented a good chew each time, in other words you had to work to devour your meal. The vermicelli was perfectly cooked... al dente style.. where each bite of the noodles had a bite and didn't just fall apart while putting your tongue onto these noodles, the broth was nice and clean as well.\n","\n","The place was pretty busy, and even though there seemed to be only   servers working, these woman were running the rounds and working hard. If you are looking for a good place where you want some simple Canto-flare, a quick meal, just remember to bring cash (CASH-ONLY) this place will do the trick, would come back. They have an extensive menu, so if you want to go and eat the expensive dishes but are in your crappy clothes and don't want to go upscale... well you can hide out here and still enjoy to your hearts content!\n","As a first time customer, I was excited to try out Pizza Hut. But this specific location got my order wrong not once, but TWICE in a row. The second mistake could have easily put me in the hospital due to a food allergy to tomato sauce/tomatoes. \n","\n","Just a few days ago, I saw a buy- -get- -free Pizza Hut special published by the Daily Hive Vancouver article. We ordered our pizzas and went to pick them up on March  . Both pizzas were made with alfredo sauce because I am highly allergic to tomatoes and tomato sauce, which can swell up my throat and eyes, and send me to the hospital. When we got home, one of the pizzas was missing ham toppings, which is my favorite. We called into the restaurant to let them know, and the manager asked me to check under the cheese to see if there was ham. Trust me, there was none, because we ate   slices and those had no ham, so we swished the cheese off more slices and there was no ham. She generously offered another free pizza to make up for this one. \n","\n","The next day on March  , we redeemed our complimentary pizza and of course, made sure to mention several times \"alfredo sauce, because I am allergic to tomato sauce\" on the phone. We went to pick up the pizza, drove home and as I took a big bite of pizza, I immediately felt this tingling in my tongue and spat the piece out. It had TOMATO SAUCE on it. After I had repeatedly said on the phone to the female staff member that I am highly allergic to tomato sauce. On the receipt, it even said \"alfredo sauce pizza\" so it was their mistake. So I called and the staff apologized and said they will re-make another one. My husband drove over to the restaurant with the tomato sauce pizza to give it back to them (and to prove to them it was tomato sauce), but they said he can keep it for himself and they will make the alfredo sauce one free. That was nice of them to do that, but they are lucky I did not end up in the hospital from this, otherwise I would be doing much more about it than just writing on Yelp!\n","\n","So this is now   times in a row that a pizza has gone wrong from Pizza Hut within   hours! Ironically, we got a free pizza to replace a wrong pizza... but then the free pizza was made wrong (with tomato sauce)... so we got a free one to replace that. Such a strange and time-wasting experience. We have ordered from Pizza Hut twice now, and both times were wrong pizzas (with one that jeopardized my health), and although people say \"third time's the charm\", I don't want to waste any more time with them.\n","\n","The staff member explained to me that their restaurant was very busy ever since the buy   - get   free deal started (for March   -  ) and that  % of their orders are tomato sauce, which is why they mistakenly made mine with tomato sauce. That's a terrible excuse, because I order from Dominos and Panagos all the time with customized order \"of no tomato sauce\", and they have never gotten it wrong. So the quality control at this location is either missing, or whoever happened to make my pizza is very tired or not paying attention in the kitchen.\n","\n","At this point, I will no longer be a customer, because a) I could have been in the hospital from their mistake and b) it wasted our time to drive back and forth for the wrong pizza. Even the free pizzas are not worth it. The only reason why I didn't put   star and gave them   stars, is because they offered complimentary pizzas for their errors. However, they have definitely lost me as a customer at this point. The brand Pizza Hut definitely will not win me back and I do not even want to try other locations from them at all.\n","I'd given them a half star if I could. No Flipping way am I ever wasting my $ and time here again!!\n","\n","My original plan was to go to No   next door for Chinese food (I have been there before so I knew it was good and open  / ) but my son wanted something other than Chinese food. It was right next door so we stepped in at about  - :  pm. \n","\n","My party of  , including myself, were greeted and seated right away. We were given menus and served tea. Before we could even sip our tea, we were told that we had to move to another table, as the cooktop was not working. We had opted for the all you can eat BBQ for $  per person. I figured for that price, it was not a bad deal. \n","\n","That was my BIG MISTAKE!! First off, the menu was a tad confusing. It says all you can eat but does not specify how you order, etc. We even asked our waitress, a young woman, and she did not understand and was not really able to articulate on how to order. You get a small slip of paper with several rows of food and   columns. Basically, there are items on the left side by name (ie kalbi, rolls, pork, etc) and   rows, the first being your first order of meat choices by number of slices. \n","\n","By the time we figured out how to order and were able to get someone to help us, etc, it was probably like  - :  pm (mind you they close at midnight and if you do the all you can eat option, you can only eat for   hours). We had ordered   pieces of kalbi (you only get   pieces of kalbi per person max), a soup,   pieces of the seafood pancake, an order of sushi roll (remember you order by pieces ie  , etc and not per roll),   pieces of chicken and   pieces of pork. We were starving and quite disappointed to only see   plates of banchan. Really? Maybe it is a US thing but even when I order to go from restaurants in CA, I get at least  -  types of banchan. Plus, if you are wanting to recoup more money back from the all you can eat, shouldn't you offer more banchan in hopes that they act as fillers? \n","\n","So we get the chicken first and the pork. The kalbi finally comes and lo and behold, they bring out TWO pieces! We flagged down the young girl again and told her we ordered   pieces and know that we were allowed   max. Her reasoning was that it was a lot of meat and we would be charged extra a la carte for any meat we do not finish. UM, I am the customer and I already read that and know what I am ordering. Plus, she kept telling me, the kalbi pieces were big. (Well, according to what I saw, it was no different and no bigger than what I get when I order kalbi anywhere). Then she went on to say that it was a lot of food. How did she know if we could finish it or not??? Anyhoo, we told her we ordered   and that was what we expected. We had already been grilling our food and the flame was pretty lame and weak. The food was not grilling quickly and we were famished at this point. Each time we flagged her down to ask about the meat or for a fork (we asked FOUR times!!), the staff member would come and turn down our heat/flame. WTF? It does not take a genius to know you need flame and heat to cook, much less grill. We finally got our fork after flagging down yet the   person. We told him we had asked for a fork   times and he went and brought us   forks. Problem was, they were not super busy and at many times, their employees were just standing around. \n","\n","Their only saving grace was that their food was ok. Nothing special and definitely not worth all the drama, wait, and horrid service. I will never come back here again and hope to save other Yelpers the trouble. Take your business next door to No   or to another Korean Restaurant. I am not sure how this place stays in business. By far the worst service I have had in a long time.. and this is hard to top considering I eat out a lot.\n","Really an unfortunate experience from start to finish. It was the last day that family was visiting with us and we had heard great things from a few different people about the Buffet. We drove out for lunch at  ;  (lunch ends at  ; ). This location is NOT ideal for anyone with physical challenges unless you have accompanying people to assist. We drove up to the valet area to ask the best entry point for someone who didn't walk well. They directed us to drive to the end of the road and their would be some wheelchair parking spaces but that they didn't think we would get one. The road was one-way so for each of the  -times we approached them we had to drive in a large circle on each occasion. It should be noted that at NO point did they suggest stopping in one of the MANY MANY open Valet spots that were directly across from the entrance even though we were just there for lunch. Having a physical disability can be very hard to navigate and asking for help can be further uncomfortable but asking and being refused well... we probably should have just left but we persevered as it's far and we were hungry and expected a pleasant meal to smooth things over.\n","At the entrance to the restaurant Buffet we were made to wait while two staff spoke amongst themselves about one being slightly lost even though They were told that my mother was having difficulty standing while they spoke. The clerk then directed her to a seat and I stood there at the register awaiting their finishing so that I could pre-pay for the Buffet.\n","The host could not accommodate a seat that was a short walking distance from the food with any view so we took the longer distance to gain having a view. At this point I should mention that any number of fine establishment servers have offered to assist my mom with carrying food- but that was not the case here even among the   people that took turns at our table clearing and pouring coffee/tea.\n","Now on to the food at last- or so we hoped. What we found was a collection on dried out offerings that spoke to folks wanting to wrap up their shift more so than honouring the buffet hour. My son had to ask for something to be heated that was cold and the warming stations had sadly overcooked what might have been some delicious salmon and chicken and beef. Even the roasting stations ham was a dry offering. Their were   soup choices and all were very hot and flavourful but in an effort to safeguard against waste the bowls offered were the size of a small teacup (not even a mug). Juice, pop, frozen treats and desserts were part of the buffet. The salad bar was a nice collection of veg and a few fruits (strange that they offered fake walmart style powdered parmesan instead of real). Anyway we finished up and although the experience left much to be desired at least it gave us the rare opportunity to agree with each other in that we each thought it was not worth the trip and something to avoid repeating.\n","You have come back onto my list as a place I will come back to eat Xiao Long Bao, which is saying alot as there has been an abundance of places in Richmond that serve the infamous XLB! Chen's has always been a place where the family used to take me to have lunch, a place that has been around before all the 'high-end' Shanghainese restaurants decided to show up and dominate in their craft.\n","\n","The one thing that makes me consistantly return time and time again to this place is one dish that no-one, and I say no-one, else serves in the lower mainland.... chi-fan-gao. If you know the translation, you will know what it is, and if you don't, here is what it is: deep fried sticky rice, in the form of a patty or cake. Think of it like a McDonald's hashbrown, but made entirely of rice, crispy on the outside, and soft and gooey, but not mushy, on the inside. This item, in this day and age, is hard to find in Shanghai, let alone here. I've searched long and hard for this plate, and occasionally my grandma would send us to come get this as a take out dish for her. I have true love for this snack, through childhood and beyond!\n","\n","Chen's has been non-consistant for awhile, which makes me sometimes cringe when coming here, but on this day, I had the craving for the above treat, and with my significant other in check, decided to snack on some food. Their hours have changed, and now they are open throughout the day, where there is no break between  :  to  : , and they serve their 'dim-sum' menu throughout the day (yay!). The two things we ordered were the chi-fan gao and the XLB just to see where it stands based on all the XLB's we have had over this last little while.\n","\n","The XLB came out pretty quick, and the first thing I noticed was the change of using steam paper as the liner in the bamboo steamer, instead of their old bamboo steaming mat where they laid out the XLB's before heating them up, that is a change from before. The other thing that really caught my eye was the thin skin on each of the XLB's. Just by looking at each one of them, you could see through them, filled with soup and piping hot. There is one knock here, and that is with placement of each individual XLB, because the skin of each are now so thin, tender care is needed or a quick escape of soup due to ripping will happen. Because they were close together to eachother, some of them stuck together, and when grabbing for one, they would drag, and then the explosion/burst of soup would come.\n","\n","The place seems to have been renovated a little, but the food quality has gone back to what I remembered it when I first came here. I know I will be coming back again, and hoping that there will be consistancy moving forward. Parking is always difficult in this plaza, as there are a bunch of restaurants lined up, side by side to eachother.\n","Was invited out for dinner by a family friend and she choosed the restaurant. This was my first time having dinner at Tin Tin so I was looking forward to trying it out as it is a popular Chinese restaurant in Richmond.\n","\n","We ordered the Chinese clay pot lamb stew, deep fried fish with tofu in clay pot, deep fried bean curd with assorted mushrooms, and braised fish maw, and three bowls of white rice to share between   of us. The braised fish maw came out with the rice first. Personally, I'm not a big fan of fish maw so eating a big piece of it wasn't tasty for me but the abalone type of sauce it was braised with was excellent. I prefer fish maw in small pieces in my Chinese soup and found the fish maw in this particular dish not tender nor braised long enough. If you're a fish maw fan this dish costs about $  if you order it for dim sum/lunch and $  for dinner (as told to me by the family friend).\n","\n","Next came the deep fried bean curd with assorted mushrooms. This was a pretty good dish with lots of mushrooms. The deep fried bean curd was freshly fried and tasty, only wish there was more! After, the deep fried fish with tofu in clay pot came. This was also quite delicious except I wish it came with some kind of vegetables, though I really liked the generous amount of green onions and cilantro on top.\n","\n","Lastly came the clay pot lamb stew. Both my family and I are huge fans of this dish, as it is perfect for winter, and Tin Tin did not disappoint. In fact it was the BEST clay pot lamb stew we've ever had! Everything was simmered to perfection in the stew with the lamb and bean curd soft and tender but the romaine lettuce and chestnut slices still slightly crunchy. There was a large amount of lamb and there were no bones to be seen! Usually most Chinese restaurants version of this dish is at least half filled with chunks of tiny lamb meat attached to a large piece of bone but not at Tin Tin! Highly recommend the lamb stew to everyone who likes lamb. My family has now established Tin Tin as our new to-go place for our favourite clay pot lamb stew. \n","\n","The service was good, all the dishes were tasty, and everything in pretty big portions. As it was the family friend's treat I didn't get a good look at the bill but saw the total to be something around $ +. I'm no expert in Chinese dinner prices but it seemed a little pricey for dinner of   adults but the quality and quantity is there if this is within one's budget. Want to give Tin Tin  .  stars but since it's not possible am defaulting to   stars due to the fish maw not being tender enough (no one else at the table complained though so might just be me) and prices seem to be a little on the high side.\n","\n","Am looking forward to trying Tin Tin out for dim sum to see how it compares to their great dinner service. Dim sum starts at  :  but if you get your bill by  :  there is a  % discount, something that might be needed as am guessing dim sum will be pricier at Tin Tin than the average dim sum place in Richmond.\n","As my friend was in for ramen, I had to find a joint that wasn't insanely far from my office, but at the same time... something new that we have not tried... this was going to be tough as I had no idea where to go. Searching ramen... and in Richmond, this one came up, one review, a good experience and off we rolled to this destination. We missed the parking lot as we went to the bigger plaza next door, and eventually saw the sign for this place. We found parking in front of the restaurant, and it was pretty full, not packed... but looked good enough to walk in.\n","\n","It is your standard looking no frills ramen joint when you step in. Some attached benching seating along the sides of the restaurant, dark wooden Japanese looking tables and chairs (like something you would see in a cheap Sushi joint), a tv in the back playing soundtracks of anime series (I saw Slam Dunk, Gundam... and Naruto while I was there) which I found weird.. probably to make it more Japanese in nature.. as this clearly seemed like a Chinese place more than anything. We were quickly seated and decided to order a bowl of ramen each... I went with the miso but really wasn't wanting anything heavy.... at the same time this is ramen, this is going to be filling. We also added a side order of gyoza to pick at.\n","\n","The food didn't take too long to arrive from our table... and looking at the bowl, it was topped off with bean spouts, some long fine cut green onions, a good flat piece of chasiu, a big square piece of seaweed half submerged in the bowl.. half sticking out like a sail of a boat, and a random piece of fish cake floating to the side. The broth, while examining this closely... had nice fatty bubbles floating at the top, let's see if this thing was going to weigh me down? Surprisingly enough, the broth was light in taste, not the heavy one's people are used to in many tonkatsu style ramen joints (which is almost like everyone in the Lower Mainland) but it wasn't bad.. very clean in taste. The ramen had a slight chew.. I wouldn't call it al dente, but it was close to that. Everything melded quite well in this bowl where I even drank some of the soup, the chasui wasn't overly fat.. probably more lean, but not tough or overcooked to the point of tough.\n","\n","Not too long after eating around  /  of the bowl our gyoza came, dainty little things, nice thin wrapping pan fried to the point of a small caramalized build-up on the flat side, that was shown face up for presentation, the meat inside was still moist, and for under $  for   of them... it's a good side filler. \n","\n","As for the place itself, it is very basic, the service was pretty good, and the food didn't leave me in a dying coma state going back to work. Add another ramen joint to Richmond, an alternative, and located in a place where you can actually find parking, if you can get by the weird anime videos playing on the tv screen, and not being truly Japanese.. from my feel of this place and the workers, you should be good. Not too expensive at all... the most expensive bowl of ramen was $ ... and they do have bento boxes.... a quick solution to food without lining up at a foodcourt, we will see how this one holds up over time.\n","Location: The River Rock Casino is nice in the first place. It is well hidden on the   floor, an unassuming location. It is small but not too fancy that you felt excluded. \n","\n","Service: Awesome service and very attentive, however, that comes with the price. We even had a mini conversation with the owner over our style of dessert first. \n","\n","Price: I was gifted a Groupon for $  worth of food and drink and even though it went far between us two, I wouldn't come back without a Groupon. The food is extremely expensive (  star food) and the portions are small. Even for an anniversary dinner, there are other restaurants that I could hit up on my radar. \n","\n","Considering the class and expensive-ness, I treated my review below as I would a judge from Iron Chief. \n","\n","Rabbit Consomme\n","Braised leg meat, spinach and ricotta ravioli, tomato confit, picholine olives, roasted fennel. This was my first time having rabbit believe or not. To me the rabbit tasted like chicken. It actually tasted good and the broth wasn't too salty. The ravioli was lacking in flavor, I barely tasted the spinach and cheese balance. I didn't taste the tomato nor the fennel. It seemed as though it was lacking that spark. In other words, the dish looked good on paper, however, lost me at first bite. \n","\n","Duck Confit & Foie Gras\n","Peking duck leg confit, pan seared foie gras, pain d'epices, caramelized pear, apple reduction. Holy fuck this was the saltiest thing that I've ever eaten. It was hard for me to appreciate the chicken 'cause I felt like a rabbit licking a salt lick. I really wanted to taste the gaminess of the foie gras but was lost in the sodium suicide. There wasn't enough caramelized pear to offset the unbalance of taste. The outside was nicely seared and crispy and the foie gras was melt in your mouth tender. \n","\n","Risotto\n","Morel and chanterelle mushrooms, sugar snap peas, preserved lemon, mascarpone cheese, arugula. OMG the risotto was nice and tender, buttery, melty and nicely spiced. A good species of mushrooms were used which complemented the dish. Points off for the arugula which was too bitter and rather than complimenting the dish it unintentionally ruined it. Arugula is best left to citrus based salads, not good risotto. \n","\n","Dark Chocolate & Mango\n","Dark chocolate and mango mousse cake, cocoa flourless biscuit, mango sorbet. For someone like myself who is trying to be gluten free, this was an awesome dessert. There was a good balance of dark chocolate and mango combination both in the sorbet and in the mousse cake. \n","\n","Creme Brulee\n","Grand Marnier creme brulee, madeleines. I could taste the Grand Marnier in the creme brulee which was a good balance and not too over powering. I tend to be a little picky about my creme brulee. \n","\n","Pineapple\n","Palm sugar roasted pineapple, lemon white chocolate mousse cheese cake, raspberry sorbet. I am not sure why this is called a pineapple when it resembled more of a white chocolate mousse cake with a thin piece of pineapple on top. This should've been called \"White chocolate mousse cake.\" A little misleading and although the dessert was good, I was thinking about ways I could make this so much better from a culinary stand point.\n","The rodents can have it i will not be going back!\n","\n","We have been to this restaurant at least   times over the last two years,the last two times ( April   within a week)  we have gone,were not good. the first time the waitress was either very new or was not supported by the other staff, we had to prompt her to order drinks and desert. Wasn't a deal breaker as we were with friends and was enjoying the conversation. But honestly when the bottle of wine was placed upside down in the wine cooler, you would think the waitress would ask if we would like another bottle. ( she never did). Since there were four of us, and we each had a glass ( and nothing else) it was not as if she would be concerned we were over consuming.  Had to ask for refills of coffee and water, it was like she was a deer in the headlights and was definitely in over her head. Just chocked it up to being new, and learning the job. Not a deal breaker but not impressed considering the cost of the meal. We just chocked it up to a \"off\" night, but it didn't prepare us for our next visit almost a week later. \n","\n","So the second time, we were planning to go to another restaurant, unfortunately it closed early ( . ) so we decided to go back again to the blue canoe. Well this time the waitress we had  was on point and the food was excellent, abiet Portions were small ( I had the Piaaya which I found very tasty, but the  portion was extremely small for the price ( which I commented on the comment card hoping the next time I was, in it would be to my liking ) Over all we had a great time. But being one last couples in the restaurant portion, and being near closing what I was shocked to see, was a mouse ( or small rat not sure?), since my wife screams at any rodent in a   ft range, I decided to warn her. I tried not to let it ruin my desert and the evening up to this point. \n","\n","But what happened next pushed me over the edge. As I am watching the one rodent,  a group of Mouse/Rats also came out looking for floor scraps, from behind the booth, Now   more of his brothers and sisters have joined their brother, all scampering around  looking for food. So now we have   of the little critters looking for food.\n","Horrified, I mentioned it to the waitress, and although she seemed slightly shocked ( hard to tell) she offered to move us closer to the noisey bar portion. So we could finish, our desert and glass of wine. \n","\n","At which time, I watched the Mice/Small rats?? scurry all around the dinning room, ( luckly my wife had her back to it, ) So i mentioned it to one of the male wait staff and he to my horror, said oh yeah, they come out when no one is around!!!!, and since we are so close to the water it can be expected.  At which time, my wife finished here wine and we quickly left. Tried to find the manager, but it looked like he was having a good time behind the bar, and honestly i just wanted to get out of there, Meal was paid for at this time, no one offered to comp it, and honestly at that point, didn't care just wanted to get out of the restaurant. \n","\n","Not impressed, I will never go back, sorry but the thought of mice running around when no one is there, especially on the cutery, is disgusting!!!!. \n","\n","Tired to phone the manager but talked to the Supervisor on duty this morning, and explained the situation. tough place for her to be in, but honestly placating me is the least of their problems they need to call in an exterminator. Asap!!!! \n","\n","As of this moment I am still waiting to hear back from the manager, should be interesting if he calls. This happened on a Saturday night, but honestly It took me a couple of days to calm down, before I wanted to put this out there. In this day and age, having mice in a restaurant running around is not acceptable!\n","Wow. Just say NO to Chinese New Year here if you are Caucasian. Had the utmost worst experience tonight. Have been going here for many years for the excellent dim sum. Also one previous CNY which was excellent in food and service. Booked the CNY reservation weeks beforehand. Confirmed three days ago - to say we were a smaller party due to the Super Bowl being on the same day. Asked can we do the menu for ten for   people. Hmm would have to have someone call me back which they did. I spoke with WINSTON who said hey no problem we can do the $  menu for eight/pro rated but not seven. ($ )  I'm okay with that. So we'll eat for eight. Arrive at SSW at  :  get ushered towards the main dining room which is unusual for Caucasian and I am relieved. We usually get the crappy tables in the middle of the back room or next to the loud dish service stations. They have the largest portion of the main restaraunt blocked off with faux wood divider with the exception of three tables up against the windows. It was a banquet/silent auction/live action/very terrible talent show going on including personal address system on the other side of that divider. We could not even speak nicely amongst out small party without raising our voice. Really? Common - This was a meld of four families looking for a nice night out not to be in a a hallway listening to this loud obnoxious whatever the hell banquet. The hostess was very clear we needed to vacate at  : . Really? I asked what time we would expect that noise to be shut down and was told seven. Well that held as much truth as the prorating of our bill. Bow shit. The loud banquet or whatever it was was still going strong at   : . We Finally got our dessert at about  :  so do not feel bad about the  + overflow they had in the lobby. When the bill came it was for   people ($ ) what a (non) surprise. Bastards. I mean we had drinks and wine on top of that. We were seven, willing to pay for eight and charged for ten. Winston came over and I reminded him of our telephone conversation of two days prior. His answer was he accommodated our request by removing the number of chairs at our table to reduce our party. (Oh I hope he had an assistant for that) Played the I Don't Speak English Card. I made it very clear during our telephone conversation that I needed the menu price adjusted or we'd just order off of the regular menu for seven. He did not - billed full price for   and pretended he did not know otherwise. Four women, three men we cannot eat that much. After tonight I will not ever be returning nor recommending. The fact we were subjected to the ridiculously loud over the top party going was reason enough for some consideration of the price of our meal even before the table size adjustment. Terrible terrible PR on this Winston and Gang. We Lo Fan put up with a lot of BS to eat the top notch Asian food but tonight was inexcusable. Shame on you. Food was excellent but not enough to have me return. Suggest going to any Kirin Restaurant location for fellow Causcasion people where you might get some respect with your meal and even better quality food.\n","The Richmond Night Market is quite an experience... between the crowds, food, and random goods you can buy, I'd say it's definitely work checking out if you're here during the summer! Note, all prices are in CAD.\n","\n","There is a line to get in and admission is like $ . , cash only. You can skip it with the zoom pass - $  for   people, or you can use the remaining entrances for another visit.\n","\n","Sadly we did not find a group of people to join, so we opted to wait in line... which honestly wasn't too bad at around  : , took about   minutes to get in and we just spend the time chatting with each other / sneaking peaks over the fence on what's available. \n","\n","Food is kind of expensive - I recommend eating beforehand and eating a late night snack here. Most stalls cost you at least $ . They sell a coupon book for $  which has coupons for some popular stalls like the rotato and skewers.\n","\n","My picks for things to eat are the following:\n","\n","- Rotato: I know paying $  for a deep fried spiral cut potato on a stick sounds ridiculous... but it's actually really good. I think the Richmond Night Market is the only place that does it right. I've had them in cafes outside of the night market, but they just aren't as crispy. This line will ALWAYS be long, so expect at least a   minute wait for pick up. It may also be a fight to get to the front when your number is called. My go to flavors are sour cream & onion or roasted garlic pepper. Nori seaweed is very good but won't be as pronounced as the other flavors. The spicy one is not that spicy, but otherwise good. Eat them while they're hot!\n","\n","- Taiyaki: Rarely do I have fresh taiyaki made in front of me... it's as you expect, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, like a waffle shaped fish with a surprise inside! The stall has Kit Kat, custard, and red bean. Red bean is the best out of the  . Worth it at $ , and you can get $  off with the coupon booklet on   orders. For an additional $  you can get it topped with ice cream.\n","\n","- Takoyaki: There are going to be at least   stalls that have takoyaki, pick one that'll fit your fancy. Some places have wasabi mayo, curry powder, kimchi, or they'll have giant takoyaki the size of a small baseball.\n","\n","- Fried / BBQ Squid: Squid is very popular, and there's a booth that sells BBQ squid and one that sells deep fried squid tentacles. I prefer the deep fried squid tentacles - the squid itself is tasteless and expensive... so why not get the deep fried one for the crunch factor? Filipinos, try to bring a small bottle of vinegar to dip your squid in!\n","\n","There are other foodie things to try like egg waffles, freak shakes, popcorn chicken, lamb skewers, dim sum, etc... so make sure to walk around and get a feel for what's available. It's a foodie's paradise, even if your wallets are going to hate you.\n","\n","Also don't get boba here - I notice a lot of the vendors are available at food courts outside the market, and they tend to mark up prices for the night market. If you're looking for a drink, go for the fresh fruit juices. It's pretty amusing to walk around with a pineapple cup or watermelon cup, and they're as fresh as you can get. Or better yet - bring bottles of water to avoid paying for overpriced drinks. That's how they get you with their super savory food!\n","\n","The night market is super crowded and finding a table may be difficult - be flexible on sharing a table with other people. They have actual bathroom trailers (not portables) which is nice. Funny thing they had   women bathrooms and   male bathroom, which worked out really well compared to how it was in the past.\n","\n","Aside from eating, walking around the Night Market is fun in itself - this year the theme was dinosaurs so there were a lot of silly dinosaur displays around the market that would move and make sounds. The LED cherry blossom trees are a nice sight. They also had carnival games for some huge plushies.\n","\n","It's also a great place to look for cellphone accessories... though you use an Android phone, don't even bother because there aren't a lot of choices for cute designs. iPhones get all the good phone cases. -_- There are also a lot of anime goodies like plushies, keychains, and posters. Be sure to flip through the coupon book, since some vendors offer coupons in it to help you save a little $$$. Most stalls are cash only, so be sure to bring enough cash if you anticipate buying something, otherwise there's an ATM onsite.\n","\n","One last thing - I don't recommend parking here. Take the Skytrain if you can or if you plan on staying overnight in Canada, stay at a hotel nearby. It's really hard to get into the parking lot and likewise, it's also really hard to get out. There tends to be a lot of traffic.\n","Our search for the best authentic Chinese dim sum restaurant outside of Asia has taken us back to Vancouver a second time in   years. We have been to Fisherman's Terrace   times.  After today's visit, I have to give Fisherman's Terrace   stars and also rank it number one on my Best Chinese Dim Sum in North America list.\n","\n","The table setting is elegant and Hong Kong style with a pair of common chopsticks and painted table wares.  Hot tea also automatically comes with a pot of hot water.  Service is at least a notch above the average Chinese restaurants.\n","\n","Those who complain about the chaotic wait and bad service, I can almost guarantee you that they arrive at around   PM on a Saturday or Sunday.  Every good dim sum restaurant is chaotic at that time, and if it's not, you don't want to eat there -- the food can't be any good.\n","\n","The dim sum we had today was absolutely one of the best outside of Hong Kong.\n","\n","Har Gow:  The skin is thin just like it is supposed to be.  The filling is made with fresh shrimps and it is moist and yummy.\n","\n","Fish, Peanuts and Pork Spare Ribs Congee:  The congee is perfectly made, with the rice completely melted into a smooth liquid with just the right consistency.  It tastes great and the pork spare ribs in the congee are very tender.\n","\n","Pan Fried Taro Cake:  Nicely fried to golden brown, it has large chunks of taro pieces that taste fresh and flavorful.  \n","\n","Cilantro and Beef Siu Mai:  This dish is rare and hard to find in North America.  Even in Asia, you don't find it in every restaurant.  The dish is not to be confused with the regular beef balls that are very commonplace.  The beef siu mai today is absolutely heavenly -- maybe it is really that good or just the fact that I have been depraved of this dish since my last visit to Maxim Palace in Hong Kong a year ago.\n","\n","Pan Fried Pork Bun:  The bun was pan fried to golden brown and the filling is moist with a slight juice pocket.  The bun is very soft and it absorbs some of the juice (hence a smaller juice pocket).  The filling is delicious, with a rich black mushroom flavor.\n","\n","Pork Spare Ribs:  The portion is generous and it had a lot of meat (versus many restaurants give you more bones than meat).  It tasted good but not great -- too salty today.  This is probably the only dish we had today that had a slight flaw.\n","\n","Every dish was served steaming hot -- so hot that the steam messed up my lens and I had to wait for the food to cool down to take my pictures.  This is the way dim sum is supposed to be served -- so hot that you will almost always burn the tip of your tongue slightly if you are not careful.\n","\n","Fisherman's Terrace is definitely   stars and is ranked number one on my list of the best dim sum restaurants in North America as of this writing.\n","I wish I'd read the reviews before walking in.\n","\n","Waitress Fail - Restaurant Fail.\n","\n","I sat down and started looking at the menu.  The waitress approached before I had seen everything, but I didn't yet see a GYRO listed.  I asked, do you serve Gyro?  She replied, yes..it's Donair on this menu.  I said, your donair doesn't show lamb.  Is it shaved lamb?  She replied, Yes, but lamb for $  more.\n","\n","I ordered a saganaki appetizer and a Gyro.  \n","\n","The $  saganaki came out, the waitress apologized that the flame had gone out, and it was a moderatly tasty appetizer.\n","\n","After awhile, the waitress brought the Gyro, and announced it as Lamb Souvlaki.  A plate with a kabob of hunks of lamb, a large mound of rice, a potato, and some salad.  I reminded her of our conversation that I had ordered a lamb Gyro, not souvlaki.  She apologized, but made the excuse that she is bad at multi-tasking, and she wrote lamb on her pad.  She forgot, and ordered the wrong dish.  But, she can fix it.  \n","\n","I'm not really interested in excuses, but told her I could wait for the gyro.\n","\n","  minutes later, the same plate comes out.  This time the hunks of lamb (now cold) are wrapped in a pita.  The rest of the sides are the same.  I tried a bite, but it certainly wasn't a Greek gyro with shaved lamb.  It was tasteless and further, not what I wanted or ordered.\n","\n","I pushed the plate away and asked for the check.  The dim waitress asked if I wanted the dish wrapped to go.  I explained that it wasn't what I wanted, didn't like it, and would simply like to pay.  She persisted in telling me she could wrap it, and wouldn't take the fact that I didn't like it to heart.  I was prepared to pay for the mistake, and just wanted to leave.  That's when the waitress and this establishment earned this review and my one-star rating.  The waitress had the gall to tell me that a gyro was a Turkish food item and a donar was Greek.  And, this was a Greek restaurant.  I kept my cool, explained to her that she was  % wrong, and PLEASE get me the check.\n","\n","The waitress returned with the $  bill, for a meal in which I only ate a $  appetizer.  I paid and left, but ultimately realize I never should have paid.  If I special order something that is not on a menu, and it is not done correctly, it is my fault.  If I ask a waitress if something is on the menu, and she tells me it is under a different name, and after asking a clarifying question, still tells me that's what I want...it is the waitress/restaurant's fault.  \n","\n","The waitress even commented that she felt so badly, as she ran my credit card for the total amount.  REALLY?  Is she not authorized to fix her own error?!?!?\n","\n","Conclusion:  Skip this restaurant.  You, and your money, can do much better.\n","I travel to Richmond several times a month from Seattle and one of the highlights is the immense selection of fantastic asian food.  Unfortunately Pot Belly Hot Pot is a black mark on Richmond's fine culinary reputation.   Originally put off by the low yelp rating, I ended up at Pot Belly because of the long wait for seating at nearby highly rated Shabu Shabu.  We'd have been better off waiting.  The initial premise at Pot Belly seems decent enough: circle your selections on a laminated menu.  Chose from either straight hot pot or a pricier hot pot/bbq combo. Each comes with rice and a deep fried appetizer.  I ordered the combo.  Although all of the tables feature individual induction cooktops, the restaurant actually serves their hot pot atop individual sterno stoves.  The Combo setup was amusing to say the least: A hot pot bowl divided into a soup pot and griddle surface.  It's a stretch to call meat seared on latter BBQ.    The amusement turned to horror when our trays of meat were brought out.  My beef tray consisted of the ugliest, most unappetizing pile of beef fat ever offered to a paying customer.  (See my photos).  Both my Chinese girlfriend and I are no strangers to asian delicacies, but we were absolutely horrified by disgusting sight before us that the restaurant tried to pass off as meat. This is the kind of stuff I would only use for bait in a crab trap or to chum the ocean to attract sharks.  We immediately complained to the waitstaff.  The waitress refused to take the pile of crap back and replace it with another protein selection.  Instead i had to order an additional tray.  I ordered seafood thinking it would be hard to screw up.  I received a tray with just two small shrimp, two small squid rings, two small (think Nigiri sized) slices of some fish and two mussels.  The tray of pink slime and fat remained on the table for the entire meal, although we did our best to push it out of sight fearing we might wretch at the sight of it.  Once we had had enough, we asked for the bill.  My girlfriend argued in Mandarin for   minutes with the waitstaff over why we should not be charged for such low quality food.  We showed them other Yelp reviewers photos of seemingly high quality meat at the same establishment and contrasted it to the pot belly pig slop they served us.   In the end the waitstaff conceded that the restaurant owner prepares the meat trays himself and that they would need to seek his permission to compensate us.  In the end they took a whopping $ .  off the bill.   Asian restaurants in Richmond are a dime a dozen.  The good ones thrive and remain for many years.   The bad ones slide beneath the waves never to be seen again.  I look forward to visiting this mini mall again and dining in whatever restaurant takes the place of the garbage hole known as Pot Belly Hot Pot.\n","Came here for a friend's birthday. Very spacious and modern looking restaurant. I really like the artwork on their walls. Since it was a big gathering of people, we had to spend at least $ /person which was quite a lot for one person but we ended up getting a good deal because we got the Samurai set which was $  for   people. \n","\n","The Samurai set started with a Gyu-Kaku salad, edamame, miso soup x  , white rice x  , spicy cold tofu, (large) fried chicken karaage and beef garlic noodles. The salad was tasty because of their house dressing which was creamy and not too heavy. The miso soup was flavorful, and it had a good amount of soft tofu and seaweed in it. The spicy cold tofu was tasty and not too spicy. I really liked the crunchy garlic sauce on top because I love garlic and it provided a nice texture to the softness of the tofu. The fried chicken karaage was crispy and delicious but there was a bit too much batter and less chicken. The dip was tasty and light which helped cut the saltiness of the chicken. The beef garlic noodles was my favorite for the starters because it was served in a hot sizzling pot so it would get slightly burnt and crunchy at the bottom. It was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked al dente. \n","\n","Next were the BBQ items which consisted of ribeye steak, skirt steak miso, Gyu-Kaku kalbi short ribs sweet soy, filet mignon, toro beef sweet soy, pork belly white soy, garlic shrimp, chicken thigh basil, zucchini, eggplant and broccoli. All the cuts of beef were super tender and flavorful so you don't really need to dip it with their complimentary sauces on the side. There was one particular cut that was way too salty but I can't remember which one it was. The shrimp was super delicious because it had garlic on it as well as salt and pepper. The chicken was also very good because it wasn't salty and it had good amount of basil flavor. The only negative comment I would make would be that I would of preferred if the vegetables came in the middle of everything so I could eat it with the meat instead of just eating all meat in one sitting and then just vegetables at the end. It would make it a complete meal if it was eaten together. Also, it would of helped cut the fattiness of the meat. \n","\n","Finally it was dessert time! We had the options to pick either s'mores or ice cream which I wanted both but thank god my bf can't eat ice cream and he isn't a fan of s'mores so I ended up getting both! I got the black sesame ice cream which was light and refreshing but I wished it a tad more black sesame flavor. The s'mores was amazing! Oh how I missed eating them! The only thing I wished I did was to cook the marshmallow myself instead of my bf doing it because he barely toasted it. It wasn't even brown or hot enough to melt my chocolate. The chocolate was still in tact and solid lol. Don't get me wrong, it still tasted good but it would of been better if the chocolate was melting and oozing out. Also, they only give you a small piece of chocolate which I thought was sorta cheap because the graham crackers were huge and so was the marshmallow so it wasn't really proportionate. \n","\n","Overall, staff were friendly and welcoming. Food was super good. I wouldn't mind coming back here again!\n","We had a really lovely time at Toku on Saturday night for my birthday dinner. I'm giving   stars for the food,  .  stars for the ambiance, and   stars for the staff and customer service. I still make it a   stars, because the staff let us do our own thing and let us sit there until late. We weren't watching the time and didn't notice what time they closed. We were just having too much of a good time at this restaurant to notice. I had planned for the party to be   -  : , but we were there until almost   and didn't even notice the time. Oh my goodness, thank you Toku.\n","\n","Staff:\n","I was bringing a birthday cake and had asked them if it was okay to put it in the fridge. Some restaurants don't allow that, so if that was the case, I would bring my own container with ice packs and leave it on a seat or side area. I brought my own lighter, because I had my own sparkler candles. But they had a lighter, placed the cake onto a pretty glass plate, and provided paper plates and a large cutting knife for it. That was beyond my expectations, because in previous restaurants, they just pass me the cake in a box and let us deal with it. This was the first time a restaurant took the whole cake out and placed it on a separate platter. If you are bringing a cake, I recommend that you bring a cake tray knife however, to slide cake slices onto. They were very nice and let us stay way past closing time. (I had a poor experience at a previous different restaurant, that came to us and said \"Your time limit is up, you have to leave\" on one of my past birthdays, and I decided never to go to that particular restaurant ever again to host anything at.) They also separated the bills for guests to make everything easy. \n","\n","Food & Food Presentation:\n","Food was styled very nicely, as you can see in my collage photos. The desserts also look pretty here. My friends decided they will return to this restaurant just to try the dessert boxes. I will be coming back again to try other items from their menu later this week, one of my girl friends will be going next week for lunch, and a guy friend said he will come back just for dessert box, so they already won a few returning customers from our party.\n","\n","Ambiance:\n","I would say it's a bit of a hit-and-miss, depending on where you sit. We had a great spot, right by the window. It was recommended by the staff for natural lighting, because they knew we would be taking foodie photos for our instagrams. The only thing that wasn't as great was there was a toy area near us, with children playing in it, so that part was a little weird. I felt like there is a daycare right in front of us. It's a nice gesture for families with children, but just kind of weird for photo ops when we are taking pics and there is a toy house area with kids playing behind us, lol. Plus kids running around make me nervous when I'm eating, so that part I  would say only give  .  stars. \n","\n","But overall, a solid   points for the lovely experience from polite and professional staff who could accommodate our party, and for the stylish food presentation.\n","Goodbye IKEA Richmond on Sweden Way.\n","\n","Hello IKEA Richmond on Jacombs Road.\n","\n","The new store is adjacent to the previous one.  I came here last week (April  ,  ) for the grand opening.  All I can say is \"This sh*t is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S!\"\n","\n","I can only assume that IKEA dropped some serious coin on this new store.  The large sign out front can be seen from kilometres away.  I saw at least a dozen auxiliary RCMP directing traffic and they even had a sign on the north end of the Knight Street bridge warning that there was a special event and to use alternate routes.\n","\n","I've never been inside the IKEA Coquitlam store so I can't compare it to the new Richmond location.  This new store is absolutely huge.\n","\n","I have to admit, I was a little envious of the kids in the ballroom.  It seems huge in comparison to the ballroom in the old store and there was even a lineup of parents and kids to get in.  The kids inside seemed to be having an awesome time.\n","\n","The new restaurant on the upper floor is the size of a mall food court.  It's very bright with large windows and opens up over the lower floor.  There's also a cute kids area with child-sized tables and chairs.  The kitchen is huge and has two sides serving the same food in order to be able to serve patrons twice as fast.  The food is just OK, but is priced reasonably.  It's a good way to fuel up before a long trek through the showroom.\n","\n","The showroom is also on the upper floor and is extensive with lots of furniture layout and decorating ideas.  Even if you're not an IKEA fan, I think it's worth coming here to get some ideas if you plan to re-decorate.\n","\n","After the showroom, you go back down to the lower floor to the marketplace.  I love the little knick-knacks that can be found here as well as reasonably priced and stylish tableware, kitchenware, and lighting options.  Past the showroom is the self-serve warehouse.  This is much bigger than the one in the old store and, as such, they are able to carry a larger number of items than before.  No need to make the trek out to Coquitlam any more for that elusive piece of Swedish furniture.\n","\n","During my trip through the marketplace, there was an announcement: \"...there is a code   at the top of the escalator.\" A few minutes later, there was another announcement, \"...the code   is over.\"  A friend Googled it later and informed me that \"code  \" means lost child and, when the child is found, they announce that it is over.  Whew, another one of life's mysteries solved.\n","\n","I was a little disappointed in IKEA's \"Everyone is a Coupon\" campaign.  I asked an employee about it as we were checking out and she said that there was no additional discount at the cashier, and that the deals were only on certain items.  I guess I was hoping for something like  % off per person you bring with you (up to   people) or something to that effect.\n","\n","In any case, this is a pretty cool new store.  I can only hope the traffic dies down soon.\n","\n","Tip: Don't get a cart from the parking lot if you plan on looking around in the showroom upstairs.  It can be a pain to take   elevators from the parking lot to the showroom level.  Instead, get a cart at the lower marketplace level once you've looked around the upstairs showroom.\n","\n","Food for thought: I wonder if they'll rename Sweden Way now that the IKEA is no longer there.  How about \"Home Depot Way\"?  :P\n","Cocoru faces Alexandra on the north side and is part of a strip mall in   Alexandra with unit   on the door.  \n","\n","Korean fried chicken and beer places are right up my alley.  With pay parking on the street, a big parking lot beside   that has signs saying the parking there is for Jade I figured it was probably best to park behind the building that's designated for businesses in  .  This parking lot has limited spaces it seems but I did manage to find out near the bushes at the back.\n","\n","This place isn't that big but is had exactly what I was looking for in Richmond where Cantonese and sushi places seem to be outnumbering places like this.  The menu is basically all fried chicken, whether half or full orders bone in or boneless.  I'm more partial to bone in whole chickens or wings straight up but the review by Annie S. convinced me to give the boneless a try.  \n","\n","I didn't eat lunch on the evening I went to Cocoru so I was really hungry and ready to eat a lot.  I ended up getting   half orders (half/half) so I could have   different flavors and I ended up going with one of my favs which is garlic/soy and one that read to be interesting which was Yangnyeom.  I had my fair share of fries during this week long business trip so I was so ready to have a modest bowl of steamed rice instead.\n","\n","I've been to quite a few KFC places and when I see half order, I'm really used to just seeing what I consider a more conservative serving/portion.  I mean boneless chicken being de-boned thigh is generally juicy and succulent.  I'd rather have boneless thigh than breast which is heavier, more dense but drier.  When I was eventually served what I ordered it was sort of intimidating.  What was served looked to be about   pounds of chicken in a pretty deep and large aluminum tray.  To put the quantity of food I received into perspective if I had to measure it in McDonald's chicken McNuggets it visually looked to be about say   to   nuggets or so.  That's a lot of food for say   people but it's a ridiculous amount for one person (myself).  Add in the bowl of rice for some starch and this is a LOT of bang for the buck.  \n","\n","Half/Half is just over   bucks, a bowl of rice... what a buck and a half?  I had a beer too.  This meal which is large enough for   was barely   bucks.  The chicken was freshly deep fried and steaming hot.  I had to wait a while to get to try it because it was so fresh.  The garlic soy seemed a bit mild but it did have garlic shavings in there to kick it up a bit with a bite here and there.  The Yangnyeom had crushed peanut crumbs sprinkled on the pieces and had a bit of a sweet and spicy kick to it.  \n","\n","This chicken although it wasn't the absolute best I've ever had as far as KFC goes (still tips cap to Turntable in NYC) this boneless version is a really good offering with contrasting flavors and a good, healthy, generous serving.  As I was saying I'm used to smaller servings in Toronto.  Nowhere in my head could I conceive this much chicken for that much money.  It simply didn't compute for me.  It was simply too good of a deal for the over the top quantity of good quality food.  While it didn't make sense, I gladly accepted.\n","\n","Cocoru, the bottom line is   people can eat here for less than   bucks for what would cost in most KFC places in Toronto cost more.  The service was good and the food was better than just good.  Parking could be a pain but not impossible.  \n","\n","I'd recommend going with say   people, get   flavors (half/half and another flavor) and mix possibly bone in and boneless to get a variety so you can have more variety.  \n","\n","I don't hit the west coast as often as I used to but I hope this place is around forever so I have a place to hit up each time I'm flying out of YVR.\n","While taking a stroll through Aberdeen Centre a few days ago, my girlfriend and I came across Aoyama Cafe.\n","We peeked inside and saw some very interesting dishes that the customers were having so we decided to try Aoyama Cafe out. So we got some friends and we hit up Aoyama Cafe on a Friday night.\n","\n","We arrived at about   and the place was pretty packed. We did not have a reservation so we had a   wait time. It went by fast since there were a lot of stores to keep us busy in Aberdeen centre.\n","\n","Once it was our turn, they gave us a call and we were promptly seated. The interior was spacious with a very high ceiling. It was nicely lit and had some very comfortable seats. Though, the ones we sat on did not actually have a back.\n","\n","The first thing about Aoyama Cafe is the massive amount of selection you have. They serve a variety of their specialty siphoned coffees, Japanese inspired salads, pizza toast, sandwiches, spaghetti, spaghetti soup, curry, rice dishes, casseroles, omurice (omelet), French toast, crepes, Harumaki (cheesecake-like filled pastry), parfaits and drinks. Their menu is just crammed with selection and wonderful pictures of the dishes. It sure made decision making hard.\n","Note, they also have a breakfast menu section as well with a bunch of other selection.\n","\n","So a fun part about this place is this buzzer. When you require service, just push the button and someone will show up. So no more looking for a server, just buzz and wait.\n","\n","This lovely dish is the Chicken Japanese Style Omurice. A curried rice pilaf inside a thin Japanese egg omelet served with fried chicken fillet and white cream mushroom or hayashi sauce. The hayashi sauce is a great sauce for this dish.\n","\n","Next comes the Seafood Japanese Style Spaghetti Soup. A mixed seafood and spaghetti prepared in your choice of light tomato, light white cream or cream curry soup.\n","\n","This Katsu Japanese Style Curry comes with a choice of breaded pork or chicken cutlet that comes with their Japanese curry. The dish included some pickled veges on the side with slices of almonds and big chunks of potato and carrot. I had this dish personally so I have a bit more to say.\n","\n","The inclusion of the pickled vege was a great touch. After one or two mouthful of curry, take a bit of the pickled vege to refresh the taste buds. The almonds however seem to be lost in the sea of curry but it looked nice. Their breading used with this dish though was not to my personal liking. It was crispy enough for me and the pork was just a touch dry. It had some juicy parts but it was not consistent.\n","I would rate this dish as normal. It certainly was not speculator but at least it did not turn me off.\n","\n","The Cuttlefish and Cod Roe Japanese Style Spaghetti is a relatively standard dish. It is served in a seafood broth base that is topped with cuttlefish rings and cod roe and seaweed. If you are looking for a light dish this is always a good choice.\n","\n","A good meal should always end with a dessert and parfait is certainly a great choice. This evening we had the Sumiyaki Coffee Jelly topped with vanilla icecream. Now this coffee jelly is no joke. The coffee is really strong and black so unless you like your coffee black, you definitely want a bit of the vanilla icecream in each bite.\n","\n","Overall: +\n","Aoyama Cafe certainly offers me a lot of interesting choices. Their prices are very reasonable with your entree averaging really $ - . I believe I have found another new hangout spot.\n","\n","For this review with pictures. Please visit   !\n","Non-smokers, beware! This beautiful little place is a death trap for anyone allergic to smoke or to anyone who has asthma medical conditions. I would have liked to give this place a higher star review but what bothered me a lot was that they have a smoking room INDOORS. I don't know if that setup is even legal? Basically, they have an indoor patio (for smokers) connected to the rest of the restaurant with little ventilation in that smoking room. The only thing separating the smoking section from the rest of the restaurant is a glass door. So everytime the waiter opens the door to serve the smokers, a strong pungent cloud of smoke enters the cafe because the indoor patio has nowhere for the trapped smoke to go. The indoor patio is covered up so the smoke just stays within that room and you can see the clouds of smoke in that see-through room. Since the cafe is small and has no windows to open, the place starts to smell like smoke and the smoke got onto my clothes and hair. I'm also allergic to smoke so my mild asthma kicked in, which shouldn't be happening in an eatery!! Luckily, I had my inhaler and puffed several times in the bathroom, otherwise I would have to leave right away. The only reason why I stayed was because I was with some friends and we already ordered a bunch of stuff before the group of smokers arrived. In hindsight, I should have just packed my half-eaten order to go, and bid my friends farewell that night. They were somewhat annoyed by the smoke but they said they would tolerate it (since no one had Asthma), but they did say they won't return because of the smell. Anyway, I would be worried for patrons with more severe asthma. I went to the doctor the next morning just to doublecheck I was ok, and he said he was surprised because he said that smoking set-up is unhealthy and unhygenic for an eating establishment.\n","\n","Twinkle is a new venue that just opened a month or   ago, and I noticed the lack of patrons in the cafe at night. I assume it's because they were also bothered by the smoke. It's too bad, this is actually a pretty place with twinkling lights on the ceiling and a cozy quiet place for a romantic date! The customer service is very friendly as well. But like I mentioned above, if smokers visit on the same evening that you do, your night will be ruined if you are sensitive to smoke or don't like the smell of smoke. I really wanted to like this place, but I won't go back because I happened to come at a night when they had a group of heavy smokers sit in... and I don't want to chance that again. If you're a smoker, then this is a rare great venue for you to be smoking indoors.\n","\n","If they ever get rid of the smoking room, let me know and I will be happy to go back. I like the decor and coziness  of the place.... if I can breathe in there.\n","\n","(Why did I not give this a   star? Because the customer service was extremely friendly, the decor was cute, and their drinks were pretty good. I only give out   stars when I am treated poorly by staff, but the staff here were nice and took time to explain their menu.)\n","TIP: All bubbletea and specialty beverages are  % off after   everyday at this venue. To beat the rush on Friday and Saturday nights, drive to the parking lot at  : . When you get seated, take a while looking at the menu, and it will be   to get your drinks. The crowd starts coming in around  :  -  :  timeframe so you will have beat the parking and crowd rush.\n","\n","This place has loud pop/club music and is very lively with chatter and waiters yelling out greetings, so it's great if you want a busy casual place to keep you awake. This is good for groups; I notice people coming in groups of   -   people. The crowd is very noisy and they are in the   year old range in very casual wear.  If you're looking for a low-key, romantic, or quiet venue, then this is not it (I would advise you to head over to the classy Leisure Tea instead for that environment). \n","\n","It's a busy place on weekend nights, especially after   since everyone is coming in for the  % drinks and lots of people are also doing the takeouts for bubble teas. Waiters are very busy. They will sit you promptly, but it might be a bit of a wait for your food and drinks, and it was a long wait for us to get our bill.\n","\n","The menu had us chuckling. All their buns were listed as \"bums\". We ordered the Deep Fried Chinese Bun with condensed milk, and   bubbleteas (Grapefruit and Mocha). The grapefruit bubble tea was very refreshing and flavorful, and had grapefruit pulp on the bottom. I absolutely loved it. But the Mocha bubble tea was somewhat bitter and had a weak coffee taste. My husband said he liked Trues Tea's Mocha bubble tea much better. The total came to $ . . We gave a waiter a $  dollar bill, and he asked us if we wanted change. That was a little weird, was he expecting a  % tip?  I'm sure he didn't even know or look at the bill so he probably didn't know what our bill came to. The waiters interchange and share duties so we had a different person serve us and seat us, but another guy take our bill and payment. They were all very cheerful and nice people, and they do yell out \"Goodbye\" when each customer is leaving. It's funny, because they yell across the room in a huge booming voice, but at least they acknowledge every person coming in and out. A+ for customer service!\n","\n","A hidden dessert they have here is the Potted Plant Pudding. Had I known, I would have ordered one, so I will go back another time and get one, then review it and upload a photo on here. We decided not to come in during the weekend rush, and drove in on a Sunday night at  : . It still got crowded with a small line-up starting around the  :  mark, but the line-ups moved really fast (about   -   minute waiting time). Avoid the Friday and Saturday night visits.\n","I take my fried chicken seriously.  As such, LA Chicken has been recommended to me repeatedly.  I had this bad boy bookmarked on my Yelp list for a long time but I'm never in Richmond.  Since I have less than a month left in this city before hitting greener pastures, it was on my 'must hit' joints.  I was beckoned to hit it up on National Fried Chicken Day and thus I was met with providence.\n","\n","To begin, I am a big fan of Church's Chicken ( ) and it's a no-brainer better than KFC.  And to be honest, I don't really count restaurant fried chicken as 'true' fried chicken.  I've been recommended some places like Chewies - but it's a different game from fast food chicken.  Like pho, fried chicken is one of the few things where 'ghetto-ness' directly correlates with 'quality' for me.\n","\n","Anyways - my buddy and I roll out and decide to chop a  -piece family meal which comes with gravy and fries for about ~$ .  Please note that this is MIXED - we were disappointed to get chicken breast with our meal.  Yes, I'm aware white meat is usually more expensive because it's rarer - but the shit is so dry and flavourless.  Anyone that knows anything about fried chicken knows the money parts are the dark meat - the legs and thighs combo is cheaper which is sort of a surprise as I noticed most of the clientele is Asian.  Also - although it is not listed on the menu, we replaced the fries with rice.  Yup - rice - gravy, rice and fried chicken.  If you haven't guessed already, my buddy is Filipino.\n","\n","So, our plan was to eat some of the chicken at the store while it's piping hot and fresh.  And then finish up the rest later in the afternoon while patio beering.  It's quite a wait for the chicken because they make it to order - no heatlamps here.  We ordered the 'spicy'  and waited...\n","\n","The chicken pieces here are huge.  I know I'm not a fan of chicken breasts, but these birds had tig ol' bitties!  It was very difficult to eat the first piece as it was piping hot and fresh out of the fryer, but it was quickly apparent - this place deserves the crown in Vancouver for best fried chicken -- crispy, succulent and perfectly fried.  The batter is a bit thicker than most places but it just adds to the crunch and it flakes off everywhere.  I highly recommend getting 'spicy' as it gives it a nice flavour kick.  This is some damned good fried chicken.\n","\n","I only wished I was closer - if so, I would definitely hit this spot pretty regularly for leg and thighs.  If you're in a rush, I recommend calling ahead as the spot is pretty busy and the chicken is made to order.\n","\n","So, I'm going to give LA Chicken a much coveted  -stars.  I just really enjoyed the chicken here.  And, this place is definitely gunning for clientele like me.  How do I know?\n","\n","Well, it was a nice summer day so I was rocking my Olympic Jordan VIIs.  Next dude in line behind us was wearing Concord XIs.  Dude behind him was rocking black and white Jordan Is.  The dude working in the kitchen was rocking an throwback Jordan tee - when he came out to help clear a table, he showed me his Chambray VIIs - they were covered in chicken grease but I respect that he was rocking them not stocking them.  Awesome fried chicken and a place to rock hot kicks?   -stars.\n","The Deluxe Chinese Restaurant lives up to their name. This modern looking restaurant is located in Richmond on the corner of Browngate and No.   Road. The ultra tall ceilings, well-appointed interior, and multi-panel large screen tv are the first things that hit you when you enter. Arriving around  :  on a Sunday, there were a moderate number of diners here but we managed to secure a table (there was a lineup by the time we left).\n","\n","Some common themes that you see here that you don't find at most other dim sum restaurants includes glass teapots which are kept warm by tealight candles, individual serving chopsticks for each diner, and western-style tea cups with handles. The dim sum menu has pictures for most of the dishes but I found that the photos for some items varied quite a lot from what we actually received on the table.\n","\n","The Three Kinds of Dumplings ($ . ) looked like an interesting dish (they didn't provide an English description of what type of dumplings they were) and came with har gow (shrimp dumpling), a green dumpling filled with shrimp and topped with a large scallop, and a yellow dumpling filled with aromatic mushrooms. As there were   pieces each, we were able to try each so this is a good choice you have a small party and you want to try a bunch of different items.\n","\n","The Deep-Fried Garlic Prawn Spring Rolls ($ . ) were one of the dishes that didn't resemble the picture in the menu. These were fairly basic... nicely fried and crisp on the outside with shrimp filling on the inside.\n","\n","Next up was the Bean Curd Wraps in Abalone Sauce ($ . ). The filling was actually pretty good in these.\n","\n","I was a bit disappointed with the Pan-Fried Pork Buns ($ . ). They lacked the noticeable darkened bottom from pan-frying process and the filling on the inside was a bit sparse and dry (no soupy goodness).\n","\n","Another dish which varied from their menu picture was their Beef Rice Rolls ($ . ). The rice rolls were pretty good but seemed a bit on the expensive side (especially when compared to what we were expecting from the menu picture).\n","\n","The Stewed Vermicelli with BBQ Duck and Salted Veggies ($ . ) arrived in a large bowl and there was plenty of vermicelli in the dish. I found the thinly sliced duck was a bit on the sparse side and you have to make sure you stir up this dish to get all of the sauce on the bottom of the bowl to mix in with the noodles.\n","\n","The last dish to arrive at our table was the Clams in Black Bean Sauce ($ . ). The clams turned out to be a good dish... the clam meat was plump and mostly large while the black bean sauce had a spicy kick to it.\n","\n","Overall, some pretty good dishes here but I wish their menu pictures were more reflective of what they served. Prices, as expected in a deluxe-type restaurant, trended on the higher side.\n","Well not had a very memorable bad experience here. Went with   of my friends. Wasn't packed full in there, maybe just over half full at the busiest while we were there. The waitress which i think was the owner or wife of owner maybe? said our rolls would be a bit slow cuz it was busy. Which ok sure it wasn't empty so we just said ok. We ordered approximately  : . food came out sluggishly slow because the sushi chef was making each order individually. I mean for one table   of us had ordered California rolls. Would you not make a bunch and give it all to our table? no he makes one order for my friend with something else he ordered. Then probably was making stuff for other tables then coming back to orders that were on our table. Throughout the night each of my friends got one of their orders one at a time every now and then. Also the waitress would get confused at what was ordered and to who and had to go back and check to see if the roll was correct or something. We were there for a long time we left at  : .   of my friends cancelled their two orders of sushi rolls they were waiting for.  The manager said it was cuz the sushi chef is new. WOW what a load of  BS. Even a new sushi chef should know how to prioritize and group his orders and make them appropriately. Least they could have done is knock off   or   percent off our bill or give us a gift card or something for a future visit. NOPE just oh sorry he's new sorry for waiting. sorry. SORRY's DO NOT MAKE CUSTOMERS come back.\n","\n","HORRIBLE experience. Ya i was laughing about it there. but i think i was a bit tipsy from drinking the large sake i ordered by myself. I don't drink sake usually or drink much at all cept a beer sometimes when i go to the pub.\n","Uhm ok ya anyways. the quality of sushi wasn't even superior to make up for it. \n","I order assorted sashimi,   toro nigiri, salmon roll, chopped scallop roll, and a cali roll.  THey were aight but i've had better. rice on one of my rolls was a bit too wet and mushy. Presentation lacked wasn't neat and clean as in other places. I've been to AYCE restaurants with better knife work. Actually the slices of my octopus on my sashimi platter was horrible. i could see the slice marks all the way down, i had at least   ridges. THAT should have a nice clean smooth slice all the way down or minimal ridges. Sashimi was fresh but the size/thickness for what i paid again was not worth it. Will i go back? maybe if management had made some kind of concession but cuz they didnt and just said sorry for the   hours of waiting for food. Heck no.  Parking around this area sucks too.  there's tons of parking spaces yet all of them have   hour reserved parking signs. ? WHAT BUSINESS needs   hour parking and that much of it? ok. short story. This place isn't worth the dime. Maybe everybody else had a good experience but for what my friends and I had.

The iced red bean drink was mediocre.\n","A Kobe priced meal with all the value of  McDonalds. This is a MUST skip restaurant. Worst service ever. The Teppanyaki guy (who looked   -  ) had almost no personality. The only good thing about the experience is that the group I went with could all laugh about how bad the service was. \n","\n","For the prices ($ .  for the steak and chicken meal), I would have thought that a higher grade meat be used. The steak was so chewy that around the table, whoever ordered it, had found themselves spitting pieces into napkins. Chewy and gross. The chicken wasn't half bad, not the best, but when you're really hungry you'll pound it down. \n","\n","The food cooked was in some cases badly burnt (the friend rice was burned bad enough that we couldn't eat it... not blackened burnt, but cooked on a dirty cooking surface that had past burnt 'taste' on it, so the rice tasted of bad burnt food).\n","\n","Myself and another in our group had food sensitivities. We related these sensitivities to the Teppanyaki chef (mushrooms and scallops) and requested that he cook those items separately. The chef made such a big scoff about how much extra work it would be to do this that I almost got up and left the restaurant right there (and I should have). I love Teppanyaki and have explored most of them in Vancouver, including the Kobe Steak House (which is one of my favorites still). None of them have ever *ever* made a commotion the way this guy did. When he finally got 'over' it, he seemed extremely annoyed with me for the remainder of the time. \n","\n","The food was so bland that I was finding myself using the extremely runny ginger sauce / paste they used to try and add flavor to the food. I ran out of the sauce after the veggies and once the burnt rubbery meat hit the plate I wanted more sauce.  The 'chef' if you can call him that, had nothing on the grill yet, in between items he's cooking and proceeds to tell me he's too busy. He told me about   times in a row that he's way too busy. 'Cant you see I'm busy cooking?' Then repeat 'see, I am too busy. You get sauce after. See. I'm busy'. Just when I think he's done being busy telling me how busy he is, with no food on his grill... he then uses both hands to sweep over the grill and says 'I'm very busy cooking, you not bug me while cooking. You wait for me to finish.' ... I just *sighed*. I'd have usually told the guy off, but would have felt bad speaking like that to an elder of such... but still, wow. Really, reallllllly bad service. I wish I'd have walked.\n","\n","I was almost going to get the owner of the establishment to let them know they should quality test the food and service of the cook, but unfortunately, all the staff of the Japanese restaurant only speak pigeon english and chinese. (Which reminds me, the cook seemed to be nicer to the chinese clients, he kept telling us when we asked him for something 'me no speak english, me only cook', which made it difficult to explain the concept of medium rare for the beef and well done for the chicken). I can only laugh at this point for how bleak the experience was. \n","\n","Save your money and just walk to the McDonald's just up the road. You'll have a better meal at  /  the price. \n","\n","If somehow you're the owner of this establishment and you're reading this. Please take it to heart. You can't charge people that kind of money for food and service so bad it's laughable. Please send in a family member or someone the cook doesn't know (an english speaker only, just so you get the proper experience). Have them grade the food and service.\n","\n","PS. Yes, they offer   for one dinners at points. It's because they *have* to... and even with that \"deal\", I'd never ever go back. \n","\n","PPS. For perspective, I've been a member here forever and almost never write reviews.

Jenny wanted to take me out for dinner and asked which place I wanted to go to.\n","I asked for \"Szechuan!\"\n","\n","\"OK we go  you drive us there\" She said.\n","Push the button to turn the car on and off we went.\n","\n","On our way down we listened to Chinese love songs in the car.\n","It was supposed to set the mood, but.....\n","\n","Me trying to sing by faking the words to music I didn't know and humming the tune a half bar late.

It was tiny and jammed packed!  \"Is this the right place?\" I asked\n","She replies \"Hmmmm I think wrong place, but I'm so hungry,OK  we eat here!\"\n","However, it was too busy and we wouldn't get a seat in time before her hunger set in and she got more crankier than she usually is.\n","\n","So we went in search for the right restaurant (I did take note to check this \"wrong\" place the next time I eat out\")\n","\n","We find the place down the street.  We park, entered the place and got seated right away.  Then BAM! She's on the phone all night texting!!!!!.  So it was kinda up to me to order the food.

I must say it is better than Shanghai Cuisine, but the tofu was cubed pretty small and it was a bit greasy.  But it was alot better than having Ketchup put in it.  I really feel that it is a no no to put ketchup in it unless you are Iron Chef Chen Kinichi from Japan.  In the latter case, I'd make the exception and only if I was in Japan.\n","rating  .  solid stars.\n","\n","Fish Head Tofu soup.  - Never had this before and I had to ask her if this was good soup.  (in between her textings) she replied yes, it is good.  I couldn't find the fish head and it didn't look like the picture, but I guess there was fish head in it  The fish meat was bony, but didn't see any eyes.  It had Tofu (naturally) and pieces of that black fungus which I love so much.  The soup was a milky colour, wasn't salty and had a clean taste to it.  Simple soup.  Good.\n","rating:   stars.

I was surprised she ate so much in such a short time. She's so tiny.\n","\n","As for me?  I enjoyed my dinner.  I get excited at the presence of trying something new and that Fish Head Soup was something new enough, I almost clapped my hands when it arrived. (I didn't cause she stopped to give me a half quizzical half annoyed look.  One of those looks that says. \"OK I let you take pictures of your food, but don't clap your hands like a   year old when it shows up at the table!\"\n","\n","The Staff, if you understand how Chinese places operate, was friendly.  By other standards, say Japanese for example, was not so friendly.  It was good by any other comparison though.  So in fairness I give this place a   for tonight.  I have been told that sometimes it's top notch and other times it's not.  Consistency is probably a factor that's not prevalent here.\n","\n","*typos FOC by I-phone written just after dinner between texting.\n","Heidi Ho! Heidi Hey! Heidi Hi! HaiDiLao? HaiDiNO!\n","\n","The infamous HaiDiLao that's well known for its incredibly high level, borderline overbearing service, and the mindlessly long wait time to get a table. I've never been to a HaiDiLao in China yet, but I've read about it, watched online videos about it, and my wife has told me about it. So here's what I've been told: while you wait, you can get free manicures, massages, snacks, drinks, games to play (like mahjong or Chinese chess), and whatever you need. During dining, hair ties are immediately offered to everyone with long hair, if you have kids, they offer babysitting service, if you cough, a cup of honey lemon tea is immediately brought to you table, if you are eating alone, there's giant teddy bears to keep you company, if you spill sauce on your clothes, you'll be offered a new shirt and your soiled shirt will be cleaned and dried. There's also washroom attendants to squirt soap on your hands, hand you paper towels, and who knows what else.\n","\n","Yeah, it's that crazy. Well, for the Canadian version. It didn't live up the that hype. We got to HaiDiLao at around  , and proceeded to wait  .  hours till we finally had a table. The waiting area is quite small, and what was provided? Popcorn, grapes, water, and a salty snack. There were checkers and Chinese checkers available. There were two massage chairs, but you needed to PAY using WeChat. That's it. No manicures, no free massages, or mahjong.  .  hours into our wait, the hostess brought us a bag filled with skinny strips of razor thin paper. To kill time and earn some savings, you can make tiny stars using the strips of paper.   stars yields a $ .  discount,   stars $ . , and   for $ .  off. My patience was wearing very thin already, but we just managed to get to   before we were called. The ladies at the front are really fake, robotic friendly, and not genuinely friendly as well. We've been waiting so long already, and I noticed that our number was skipped, then moved to \"being served.\"\n","\n","A computer tablet is brought to you first so you can start choosing what broth and food you want, and then finalize at your table.\n","\n","We ordered the Tomato broth and Pork bone broth. The max amount is   broths in one pot. Water broth is available too lol. The pork broth is probably the base broth for everything since when asked for a fill up, one broth was just used and it was the same white color as the pork broth. Both broths tasted pretty plain and simple.\n","\n","We ordered beef tongue and lamb. The tongue was surprisingly tough, even after cooking it for just a few seconds. There wasn't a beefy taste as well. Tongue has always been tender for me, but there was just something wrong with this tongue. The lamb was slightly better because the meat was thinly sliced with a nice amount of fat around the meat, but there wasn't the gamy taste from the lamb. I was pretty disappointed.\n","\n","The basa fish was good. Nice fresh, thick pieces. The shrimp paste was fresh and tasty. In the end, shrimp paste just became a shrimp ball.\n","\n","As for the rest, we ordered the bean curd skins, mushroom medley, tofu, Tong Ho, cellophane noodles, quail eggs, and fried Chinese crullers. You can do half orders for these, and even then, it's still a very good portion. They were all fresh and decent quality. We weren't able to finish everything and we were able to take everything back to the hotel room. We even ordered the hand made noodles too, but we had too much food already, and we weren't that satisfied with the service.\n","\n","The sauce bar was definitely one of the more extensive ones I've had. Besides the typical sesame sauce and soy sauces, there were also a few fermented bean sauces, fermented chives sauce, chili sauce, as well as additional toppings such as fried soybeans, peanuts, Thai chili, and etc. You can really make a super sauce here.\n","\n","My wife also told me about a traditional Chinese face changing show that's performed only during dinnertime. Well, that was the most disappointing show I've ever seen. The performer only stayed in one spot of the restaurant, and she was hidden in between tables. She only performed for less than five minutes. It was so bad and generic.\n","\n","Overall, I was really expecting a lot more from the food, the dining experience, the \"show,\" and pretty much everything. I thought we were all being watched by someone, so if I showed any discomfort or in need of something, someone would immediately come over to aide me. I tried, but to no avail. The food was good in quantity, but not the best of quality, and it was expensive. The service wasn't friendly or provided anything extra. Our server was barely available or seen, and whatever the servers did is to be expected.\n","\n","Sorry, I expected more, a lot more. I don't want to be making tiny stars while waiting now.I wanted that free massage when I was rolling my shoulder and feigned discomfort to the cameras. I wanted better food!\n","If you're all in for the regular pearl milk tea, not willing to spend much, only have a few bucks or spare change, have a friend with you who also wouldn't mind a drink, this is probably the best deal in town! We came here after having dim sum nearby and I was kinda craving for this drink, haven't had it in a long time, and it's sort of like McD's... when you don't have it in a long time... it just harps on you till you chase it down. I come to Yaohan with my significant other quite frequently, and we walk around the food court, and I've always known about this deal, \"  for  \", and this was the day we were going to take advantage of this.\n","\n","The  -for-  is very limited, with their regular milk tea mix, and another one which I cannot name. I'm all in for classics.. and what defines bubble tea (or if you like to call it boba, what is this.. Star Wars?) then this staple. For $ .  and your getting two regular sized cups of this housemade brew, it's cheap... dirt cheap, which makes you wonder... is it a, \"you get what you pay for scenario?\". We picked two of the same drinks, the only difference was one had the regular sized 'pearls', and the other had the mini ones! We had to wait awhile, for this price I would suggest you shut your trap too, for our drinks to come on out, but when they did we scooted away with them and found a spot in the food court. \n","\n","The one problem we found, and it's a dumb one, is that you need a ton of effort to poke a hole with the big straw into these cups, the straws aren't that strong! But after I finally lodged this thing like a missile into the cup the taste test was on! When I'm with my dear, I usually allow her to try things first... since she has a Taiwanese background and this drink was born from her homeland, might as well let her be the judge, also she is not a fan of unhealthy things, so this is a true test! It was great to see the first reaction of the cautionary suck. She smiled, and tried to hide it, as it probably brought her back to the days of her youth, and all the unhealthy foods we decided to have. She even said, this is soooooooo bad... yet pretty good. I then took the cup and drank a little with a few 'pearls' between my teeth. First to the balls in my cup, well not bad, good chew, not too slimy, easily could use as projectiles, and may stick on walls... cooked thoroughly to the core, definitely edible with a slight sweetness, not as honey sweet as some, but good, doesn't take away from the drink. The mystery milky tea liquid in the cup, not too sweet, where my dear said, \"I usually ask for less sweet, but in this case.. don't need to!\"... yes.. the right mixture. Milky enough, and not overly sweet, like the perfect mixture, it makes me want to come back and try the other stuff, like their flavoured selection.. and even their hot selection.. that will have to wait, but I definitely recommend this place.\n","\n","  cups for the price of  .. there's two other bubble tea like joints in this food court and they still haven't caught on.. or just don't want to take the loss. Don't worry, this cheap price is all good, dig up the lint covered change in your pockets and spend it happily here!\n","We decided to come to Tramonto Restaurant after hearing good reviews to celebrate my husbands   birthday.  When our drinks arrived, after a couple of sips during our conversation I realized that my drink had a fly in it. the fly was dead embedded in within the ice. When I bought this to the waiter attention, he merely brushed it off to say it was summer and these type of events occur on a regular basis. This was rather shocking !!!!  when we got thru dessert near the end I started feeling really uncomfortable in my stomach.(the lamb did not taste too well but I thought it was just me),  I went to the washroom, came back to the table but then started to break out in a sweat and cramps.  I returned back to the washroom, at which my severe cramping, diarrhea and vomitting began.  I asked my sister to get me so  -up. When she went to ask our waiter he said he had a better combination of herbs and soda, my sister explained that I would not take that but he was adamant to give her his drink, which would have been ok if he also had given her the  -up that I requested which never transpired.  I was in the washroom for over   and half, actually closer to  .   The staff never asked my sister or my husband if I was ok or better still if I needed medical attention in terms of calling an ambulance or even first aid, which apparently you have many staff trained as first aid .\n","My state at this point was like I was having contraction giving birth, sweating, severe diaherea and vomiting and severe cramping of the stomach. I was in a state of semi unconsciousness. My sister was giving me wet towels for my head. After a while  I heard the door open and heard someone come in but not use the washroom.  However the mess was really bad and being the person I am I would never expect anyone to clean up after me regardless of my state so I stumbled to the sink to get more towels and this is where I saw a female member of staff just standing there, obviously she had been told to come into the washroom to see what I was doing or what state I was in but she offered no help what so ever, even to the point of asking If I she  could pass me some towels.  At that point of seeing her my anger, frustration was beyond explainable and I just had to leave so I asked her to call my husband and to ensure that the bill was settled, once again we are not the type of people to expect free meals.\n","\n","As we are leaving there is no manager in sight.  I could see from the corner of eyes as I gripped my husband with all my might all the waiters were  are all hobbling in the corner.  when I called a few days later to complain for the lack of empathy received I was told that they mgmt that rebusiremursed our bill (which never should have been presented as all of my meal was within their waste system) and after their intensive research (  day) they found their staff were not negligent.  I escalated this to the General Manager who said the same that their staff were not negligent, I honsetly I am not sure what their defination of negligent is. Their tone was very cold and was almost like go away. All I was looking for was an apology letter to say that the mgmt was sorry for the pain and suffering that I incurred on their premises and their staff should have been more tentative to my needs. In hindsight I should have gone to the hospital and be tested but at the time when you are in so much pain thats the last place you want to be, so note for next time go to the hospital.  So if you require empathy or good service dont go to River Rock, its not a serivce they choose to provide. Pinky Surrey, BC\n","If you've never heard of Sanpoutei before, dont worry, neither have I...haha. But seriously, Sanpoutei is a popular ramen chain owned by the Sanpou group in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. \n","I for one, welcome our new ramen overlords because they're offering something pretty damn good. Sanpoutei is located in the newly built Kam Do Plaza between Aberdeen and Parker Place. Parking is somewhat aplenty, so dont worry. Since its beside Aberdeen, it is easily accessibly by transit via. Canada Line - Aberdeen Station. The exterior to the restaurant is modern yet typically Japanese, using wood grain design vinyl tape on the window frames to create an atmosphere of typical Japanese restaurants. Even the automatic sliding doors are reminiscent of my days in Japan, which by the way still have the best sliding door systems i have ever seen.\n","\n","When one walks through the sliding door, you are greeted with a giant window which peers into the noodle making room, an awsome sight to behold. Too bad the noodles arnt created by hand, instead, machinery does most of the work. The interior of the restaurant is bright, modern, and uniquely Asian/Japanese despite the heavy usage of black. Traditional noodle boxes with the Sanpoutei name line the cubbies in the walls near the rafters. The rafters feature a fine dragon print carving, something you'd expect out of an old-timey Chinese restaurant. A communal table with giant lanterns in the middle is also a nice touch. I give full marks for architectural design if I could, but unfortunately that is not one of my grading parameters for food reviews.\n","\n","The menu was pleasant to look at, nicely designed, but offered no real insight as to what things were. Their specialty Niigata Shoyu ramen doesnt tell you that its made with Bonito/fish stock, nor does their menu tell you what Tori (Chicken) means for the rest of their ramen such as Tori x Miso, or just plain old Tori Ramen for those who dont know Japanese. And that is a common complaint about the Niigata Shoyu ramen is that it's \"fishy\" and leaves a bad aftertaste. I think that's where many negative comments for Sanpoutei stem from, is the fact that many diners order the Shoyu ramen expecting something they had before, only to be digusted because of a lack of communication. Playing devils advocate here, I feel that If you're dining and expecting to write a review a restaurant, you should ALWAYS keep an open palate and judge the experience as objectively as possible. That said, it is very hard because we, as humans, always create judgement by comparing with our past experiences.\n","\n","I ordered the Niigata Shoyu, and the Oroshi Yuzu Karaage. Prior to coming to Sanpoutei, I did read some reviews, therefore I had prior knowledge that the shoyu was indeed a fish stock based ramen, but that still didn't deter me from trying it. I went with the  $ option which includes   slices of their \"Chashu\" and Ajitama.  $ is pretty steep when you compare it to other restaurants in the lower mainland, but cost aside, the ingredients are fairly premium when considered. The \"Chashu\" is actually pork belly, and not pork shoulder like many ramen restaurants, the bonito in the fish stock is not cheap as an import item, and lastly, the noodles are handmade which require labour. Speaking of noodles, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the noodles, which I did not read about prior. The noodles were delicious! They were like Taiwanese noodles you get with Beef noodles, but much thinner. I think like most people expected ramen noodles that were perfectly cut, thin, round egg noodles. It paired perfectly with the fish stock and tasted perfectly fine to me. One common complaint about the shoyu soup is that it was too oily, a complaint which I can empathize and agree with reservations. This is the part where my objectivity disappears a little; Firstly, If you know what goes into a \"real\" tonkotsu ramen, then this level of oiliness pales in comparison. Secondly, my experiences with ramen in Japan is that, everything is oily, which is why its good =D. I believe Soup takes a hit if we're viewing this objectively, but noodles get full marks.\n","\n","But what about the Chashu and Ajitama I paid for? Well, lets just say some people are willing to come back to eat just for the Chashu and Ajitama. They are well marinaded, the flavour of the marinaded as seeped into the flesh really well, allowing one to distinguish the taste and texture through the flavour of the \"fishy\" soup. The Ajitama is the same, well marinaded, softboiled with a perfectly flavourful gooey yolk. You also get \"spinach\" or so they called it, but It didnt look or taste like spinach, because it was just gailan leaves. The Oroshi Yuzu Karaage was a slight disappointment, the flavors were there, and the fry was good, but the pieces were very small and grossly overpriced for the amount of meat served.\n","\n","Unfortunately Im out of characters, \n","\n","I like Sanpoutei, and will be returning shortly.\n","\n","A Fishy but Great Four, out of Five.\n","I would give only   star but the food we did get raised it up a star. This review will be mainly about the service. \n","\n","Went there a little before dinner, just after  . Only ordered japchae and mandu since we were planning on eating later on. Our waitress seemed surprised that we were ordering so little and repeated our order back to us. \"ja-japchae, right?\" We confirmed and also reminded her that we wanted mandu as well. \n","\n","Neither my boyfriend nor I are Korean but I can understand a bit so I heard when she went to the kitchen and gossiped to her coworker that it was weird for us to be eating so little at a korean bbq restaurant.\n","\n","It took a really long time for our food to come out but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt in just this one case since we were probably just really hungry and therefore wanted our food as soon as possible. Just when I was going to inquire about how much longer our food would take, the waitress came out with our japchae. Just the japchae. We both assumed the mandu would just come out a bit later so we started eating right away. \n","\n","Although the noodles were a little tough to chew, it was overall good and we ate every last bit. By now though, we're seriously wondering where the other part of our meal is. I'm sure I caught the eyes of either waitress at least three times before they would look away, not giving me enough time to politely call them over to our table. At this point we have both emptied our glasses of water and were getting impatient, having waited for at least   minutes for anyone to come by our table for any reason really.  \n","\n","The waitress whom was appointed to attending our table, I assume, had gone on her lunch break while we were eating and only when she came back did we finally get some service. She quickly slammed- I mean, set our bill (with only the japchae on it) on the table and walked away. I called her back and she just motioned her hand at me to wait while she went to refill two other tables' waters. The other waitress came to our table instead and I told her that we had also ordered mandu. She looked confused and ran back into the kitchen to get the waitress that had originally took our order. She pointed to the menu and said \"When I asked, you ordered japchae only and not mandu.\" I politely, but firmly said no, we also ordered some mandu with our japchae. She said \"Oh, well we don't have any mandu right now.\" \n","\n","If they had mentioned beforehand that they didn't have any mandu, we wouldn't have been so unhappy but the way we were treated, we left as very unhappy customers and were even a bit mad. We did leave a tip of   cents but that was only because they were both staring daggers at our tip-less bill as we got up to leave. \n","\n","We will be recommending the place to people, but as a place to AVOID AT ALL COSTS while in Richmond.\n","I'd like to say I'm usually pretty open to trying new things; cuisines from different parts of the world fascinate me and living in the West Coast has helped me touch, or rather, taste those cuisines. For me, Vietnamese food has never been a go-to type of cuisine (compared to Japanese or Italian where I would always say yes to), until I discovered Lotus.\n","\n","This gem is located right on the other end of the city where I live. My friend was craving Pho after we saw a movie and wanted to go here. I guess I can credit her for that; I'm glad she wanted Pho that evening or I would never have known about this place.\n","\n","Since it was late when we got there, there was only one other table that was occupied. It's a spacious restaurant with a handful of TV's, all showing sports channels (on both times I've gone). I didn't mind; there was a game that night and recaps are always good. We got there pretty late, so I was expecting a bit of attitude/passive aggressiveness from our server. I was so mistaken. She was the loveliest and most courteous server! Anyway, as soon as I open the menu I find out that the selection is pretty decent. Prices are reasonable, but I wasn't sure how they defined \"regular\" vs \"large\" for their bowls of Pho. On the both times I've gone, I've tried the Pho Chin Nac, Bo Vien and the Pho Tai, Bo Vien. Both have such flavourful broths, a great amount of noodles, and excellent amount of meats. I usually like flavoured meat, but because the broth was so rich, it really gave the meat the flavour that it was lacking. It was sprinkled with chopped green onions and cilantro? Or possibly parsley, which definitely added to the dishes.\n","\n","Portion wise, I would say their 'regular' and 'large' is quite generous. Large is pretty huge and I was so full after eating two-thirds of my bowl. But I ain't gonna waste no damn Pho, especially something this delish. I had to power through that bad boy, and power through I did. You probably read that and thought of something dirty. You're filthy, so you need to stop. Anyway, $ .  for a regular and $ .  for the large is such great value, especially since it tastes this good.\n","\n","Another thing I got was the Nuoc Dua - Iced Coconut Juice with Fresh Coconut pieces ($ . ). I was told it's a lil pricey, but honestly after trying it, I think it's worth way more than that. Holy nectar of the gods, it is amazing. The first time I was there, I got my non-believer friends to try it. As soon as they did, they all ordered their own glasses. And I will quote them \"Oh wow, that IS good!\". The other time I was there, I convinced my mom and brother to try it. As soon as they did, they said the exact same thing. Just trust me on this one, try it when you're there. You will not regret it.\n","\n","As always, I like to mention bathrooms when I talk reviews. Theirs is a decent size. It's well lit, clean, and fairly stocked. No complains in that department.\n","\n","Overall I can't wait to go back and enjoy my next bowl of Pho. Actually, I would love to try their other offerings. This place seriously makes me want to have   stomachs so I can eat   meals from there. If I could give this place a   stars I would. Can I do that? Ok well consider my   stars as  . I've definitely found my go-to Vietnamese restaurant!\n","So after a long drive back from shopping in the States, our family decided to find a new restaurant to try for dinner instead of cooking.  My sister had mentioned a place close to her work whose dimsum was quite decent - so we decided to try out their dinner service.\n","\n","FIrst Impressions - Clean bright restaurant, very clean and big windows.\n","\n","We were seated almost immediately and the first I noticed after getting the tea was how dirty the teacups were.    teacups later and I asked the waitress to change the dirty ones for new ones.  She scoffed at me and returned after helping another table. Wonderful.  Not what I expect at a joint that charges $ /dish - definitely expect that at a $ /dish joint.  I didn't even mention that their dinner napkins were also caked in the food from the previous user.  Quite nasty.\n","\n","After ordering food which was quite prompt the food arrived. We weren't that hungry so we ended up order   dishes and soup for the   of us.  The Peking Duck was pretty and the waiter sliced the duck in front of us.  I had never seen this type of service in Canada before.  Only experienced something like that in Beijing so that was quite interesting.  The duck was good and the soup that arrived after was also quite decent.  To this point the only annoying part was how pushy the waitress was in asking us to finish our soup.  \n","\n","The vegetables arrived afterwards and that's when things took a turn for the worse.  The vegetables arrived with the addition of some green mold which made it extremely appetizing.  We called the manager over immediately and he simply took the plate away - no apology, no nothing.  It took me a moment to determine whether he was giving us another plate (read: remove the gross stuff and give it back) or remove it from our bill.  The vegetables came back before I could tell them to cancel it - I fed it to my compost heap at home.  \n","\n","While we were waiting for new vegetables, our cold chicken arrived.  I asked the waitress for   bowls of rice.  It took awhile to arrive but the rice did eventually come.  Wow was I surprised.  Two bowls of average size and the amount of rice was barely to the top of the bowl.  I figured that this was their size so didn't think too much of it at the time.  \n","\n","Moments later we saw another table also ordering bowls of rice which were full to the top and beaming with rice - the way I have always had rice when ordered at a restaurant.  I asked the waitress for an explanation to why we were given so little rice and her response was that it was standard to give the amount that we were given and that their bowls were \"bigger\" than most other restaurants.  Load of crap answer if you ask me but I was so fuming mad at that point I didn't really care to ask for the manager or another bowl.  She did offer to give us more after explaining the portion size of rice but i didn't care for it.  \n","\n","We barely ate the rest of the meal - the chicken was slightly overcooked and put into the ice water for too long - no flavor and very cold.  Anyone who knows my family knows that we eat chicken   to   times a week.  We LOVE chicken and know how to cook it.  \n","\n","The only bright light was another waitress who attended to us.  She always had a bright smile on her face and tried her best to make the most out of a bad situation.   She was the one who cared to check on our vegetables and the slowness of getting our rice to the table.  She also consoled us on the green mold in our vegetables and apologized for it.  Something quite honestly is the job of the manager who took the vegetables away.   If she could be rated, she'd get    stars.  This restaurant doesn't even deserve the one that is rated here.   \n","\n","Lastly, I'm not sure why this restaurant was as busy as it was.  There are many fabulous restaurants around this one with better food and service.  I definitely will never return.  I have to also add that if this was a restaurant where the dishes were around $ , my rating would be a  .  If you charge the exorbitant prices then I will expect better service and better food.  This place was simply not up to par.  \n","\n","P.S.  good luck to the engaged couple who were looking at the restaurant for their wedding!\n","How things aren't what you remembered them to be like is probably the stretch I will go when coming to a White Spot, and oddly enough I ended up here on Saturday night, not by choice, but someone who hasn't had a burger from here in more than a decade decided that they wanted one. Richmond is an odd place sometimes, especially during   PM and beyond.. a place filled with Asian food, yet most of them don't open after a certain time baffles me.. and we are left we places like this to go to. Well, this wasn't my choice, so might as well suck it up and go eat.\n","\n","When coming in here what I notice is.. nothing has really changed.. in terms of decor. Still using the old green that makes up the logo, and at night this place looks extra dark, like a restaurant from the  's. We were sat along the back, and this place was dark, probably a good way to mask how the food really looks in the light! The menu's came quite quickly and I put in an order for their Monty Mushroom Burger, and also their Chicken Pick'ns.. didn't know what to expect.. but my expectations were not high.\n","\n","Just like everything in life, prices go up.. but in White Spot's case.. I feel like we got gouged.. right between the eyes. I love how the website really doesn't show you the price (unless you really look).. but for $ .. at least.. the burgers White Spot serves better be f'ing amazing. I didn't realize time of day coincides with lack of quality, if this was the case.. maybe you should do a late-night dinner menu and discount the price by a certain percentage so you can accomodate for the lack-luster food you are serving. So when the burger came, it was pretty underwhelming. This thing looked like it was under the heat lamp for a good amount of time. The onion rings I substituted were actually pretty hefty and big, but as a substitution, paying more money, shouldn't I get the same amount of carbs that is leaving my plate... I just felt the   onion rings.. some really tiny.. didn't equate. I remember this mushroom burger really bursting at the seams with mushrooms, this one just had a bit on top of the meat, not really befitting of being called anything with a special name.. more like burger with a side of mushrooms on top please.\n","\n","The Chicken Pick'ns.. now this was really not good. Something on their menu that this was a limited time.. well hurry up and fly away, cause this secret batter was just that.. a good secret that I don't want to know about. When you're thinking that the Colonel maybe having better chicken.. you have a problem. These things looked like fried batter balls, not attractive, and to know that it was just fried chicken for   pieces at $ ... again.. what the heck is going on here.\n","\n","If you want food like this in Richmond, especially after   PM, you got slim pickings.... maybe that's why it survives, especially at outrageous prices for lackluster quality, the only reason why this doesn't go   star is that it is open late at night, and the service wasn't bad. It's going to take me awhile to come back.. but the days of remembering my childhood and the Pirate Pack are gone!\n","We've been here twice. The first time was great, we ordered shanghai fried noodles, all the varieties of xiao long Bao (shrimp, crab and the pork). The noodles we thought, were the best we've had so far in Vancouver. The xiao long bao's, I wouldn't recommend the shrimp OR crab version. Way too sweet, and not much layers in terms of taste. It's just sweet. The pork is legit though. \n","\n","However, my one star review is in regards to the SECOND time we came here. The negative reviews are true, especially towards people that don't look like they're locals OR that the owners/servers know. We're also Asian, but we generally don't speak the language as well with the same accent nor do we dress like we're locally from Richmond-Vancouver. First, it took them forever to seat us and take our order, while I noticed everyone around us who sat after us were greeted with a smile and their orders were quickly taken. That, I can ignore - i figured it's a common thing to happen in Richmond where locals are just treated better because they frequent more often than tourists. When the server finally came to take our order, everything was pretty much rushed and punched in and they didn't acknowledge or even look at us as they took our order.\n","\n","\n","The food, we ordered the chilled chicken with the mala sauce, that's fine - tasted great. Xiao long Bao, we got the pork and that tasted fine. The shanghai noodles took   minutes to come AFTER we finished all of our other dishes, but the main issue were the pea vines/dou mai that we ordered. When I took a bite into it, I realized it tasted earthy. However my partner just continued eating(because we were starving), so I assumed nothing was wrong. Halfway through I really couldn't shake the thought that it was beginning to feel gritty and really earthy so I dug around and realized, THEY DID NOT WASH THE VEGETABLES. There was still grit and sand coating some of the stalks and leaves.    Naturally, I called the servers over (and they were smiling and taking orders from another table nearby), when they turned around they answered with a frown. I specifically tried to speak in their language to tell them it wasn't washed nor was it clean. The first server rudely asked if I wanted to cancel or get a new one, I said to cancel - he huffed, slammed down the menu and walked away. As he did, another server came by with the shanghai noodles (after   minutes since we started eating), and I told her the issue again. She looked at the noodles and grumpily said in Cantonese \"you already ate most of it\". And walked away.\n","\n","\n","We did get the vegetable dish refunded, but there was no apology on their part, nor did they provide anything close to customer service on their end. We were treated like we were a burden to their establishment the whole time and this is honestly the first time we've been treated that badly and felt unwelcome at a restaurant (and we've eaten at a lot of asian, hole in the wall places places). If you're asian, but don't speak the language well or don't look the part of a HK- person living in Vancouver - don't expect good service from this place. This could be an assumption on my part, but I can't find another explanation on why we only got frowns and scowls from the moment we sat down, while other tables received smiles and courteous treatment.\n","\n","ALSO, WASH YOUR VEGETABLES. Goodness knows how much pesticide or sand we ate last night, but I'm  % sure the veggies were barely washed before they were cooked.\n","My first time here was a few weeks ago, the first week of opening. I know they just opened so I didn't want to base my opinion of the establishment quite yet, I wanted to come back after they worked out their kinks.\n","\n","My boyfriend and I ordered onion rings, bacon cheese dip, philly cheese steak with Caesar salad and a burger with Montreal smoked meat poutine as a side.... (obviously we didn't get close to finishing it all).\n","\n","The onion rings were good, and came with an awesome dip. The dip flavour wise was really tasty although the texture was that of vileeda cheese... \n","The burger was awesome... I mean the patty tastes like a Costco patty...  and it's a guilty pleasure of ours. The poutine it came with was ok... but they put dill pickles on top... and we love pickles... but it didn't really work. The quality of the meat was pretty meh... I mean, it's definitely processed meat that they buy, nothing like real Montreal smoked meat. The philly cheese steak was disgusting... the texture was off... like processed meat... but it was really greasy... not in a good way (I'm not scared of fat, of it makes for good flavour) like in a weird, this doesn't taste right kind of way. The Caesar was okay... but it came with bacon bits that tasted like they were covered in blue cheese... I wish the bartender notified me because I would have asked them to omit the bacon/blue cheese. So here's the thing... I didn't eat a lot of the food... and I could have ate more but everything was so so so so so SALTY. I get it... it's pub food, but every single component of each dish was salt on salt on salt. I hate bland food, I believe in seasoning but I'm going to be honest, I don't think I'd ever come back for a full meal because   hours have passed and   jugs of water later and I still feel uncomfortable after consuming   days worth of sodium in one sitting. And because the texture of everything just left a bad feeling lol...\n","\n","So the service... last time it was pretty bad, but I'm the industry... and I'll forgive and forget bad service. Today the service was much better... Nick was serving us st the bar. He tried to get to know us and showed that he cared. But when I asked questions about particular menu items he couldn't really answer them. Honestly, it's not his fault... the menu is huge, he hasn't had time to try everything... so my issue is with the company/management for lack of training. When you open a new establishment, it is necessary to let the staff try ALL THE FOOD so they know about it. I don't expect him to have tried everything out of pocket... also when packing up our food he forgot to pack one of our sauces when I clearly told him I wanted it packed. Also we waited about   minutes.\n","\n","Our bill was $  for   appies,   sandwiches, a Caesar and beer. Not terrible... but the food quality was pretty poor. If we actually drank... our bill would have been $  easily. I don't think it's good value... if drink and food items were  % cheaper i think I would be closer to the value it's worth. For that money I would rather go to cactus club where the food quality is undoubtedly   times better. It's too bad... because I was really looking forward to this spot... since richmond definitely needed it...\n","This place is brand new. Opened on May  , I was here last week, took some pictures of the front and decided to come back and try it out.\n","Who better than to go with than my regular Japanese foodie expert, Yasuyo (She was the love of my life).  Yas and I used to share alot in common when it came to eating out.  Especially eating at Japanese restaurants.  It was one of the things we loved to do together.  Yasuyo Loves Fugu, but were not sure if you could get it in Canada still. We figured that since it had the name, they must serve it!\n","\n","So upon entering we were politely met with a hostess who seated us at the bar.  \n","Our initial impression was a bit scary.  Nobody spoke Japanese there. Everyone, including the customers were all Chinese.  We wondered, maybe we came to the wrong place?  Well, we're here, lets try it out.\n","It is indeed a Japanese restaurant, they do have Fugu.  A live fish in a fish tank at the entrance, but it's not for eating.  Just for display. They don't serve Fugu here.  \n","We had a bit of trouble ordering our dishes since nobody spoke Japanese.  So I ordered in English reading from the menu.\n","We decided to try some stuff off the beaten path and this time I went with everything Veggie.  Here's what we had.\n","\n","Kurake-mozuku, Seamoss and jellyfish shot.  Comes in a little  wineglass and you just shoot it down. Tasty, very impressive and a little sour. I liked it very much.\n","\n","Green Salad - very fresh (basic salad greens), good for cleansing our palate.\n","\n","Enoki Yamakae - Mountain Yam paste with Enoki mushrooms.  A good alternative to the ones you usually get with Tuna.  The Yam paste was smooth, gooey, slimy good.  Mushrooms were flavoured with a bit of dashi / soyasauce.\n","\n","There were some other vegetarian dishes like Eggplant and grilled green peppers.\n","\n","The importance in the way the sushi chef made the sushi and the way the rice is flavoured is important.  He had good technique.\n","The pieces of fish was cut properly and had good size and ratio to the rice.\n","\n","The ebi was fresh prawns from the tank.  They had other fresh seafood that was in the tank behind the bar.  They even had a little tank of those little crabs that they would deep fry crispy like a cracker.\n","Yummmm.\n","\n","I have to admit.  There's alot to write about this place.  The service was good. Staff were all polite and even though I don't think anyone spoke Japanese, you couldn't tell the difference in the food.\n","Care and attention to the details and quality was good.\n","\n","So we were left very very impressed.  I'm happy to say that this got the rare   stars.  I sure hope they keep it this way and continue to prosper here.  \n","\n","This will be one of our best meals that we have had together and if it's the last, then this has been the best so far this year.\n","\n","Typo's FOC, written by i-phone, thumbs and all!\n","So impressed with this place. Went saturday night our first server was in a big jersey and pony tail, our second a tiny little brunette. It was hockey night so everyone was dressed up (or down I guess you could say haha). A couple lows but overall we had a great experience and definitely will be bringing our friends or family back here.\n","\n","Firstly, love the location. Love it's kind of a secret, n you wouldn't just drive by the place. Love the lamp posts with their own banners on the drive up. Love it's by the water.\n","\n","Ambience inside is nice, laid back but trendy. Everything is brand new. Delicious menu with lots to choose from.\n","\n","We chose the tuna appy as well as wings to start. We asked for half honey garlic half sweet chilli as our server said doing   flavours was an option. \n","\n","The tuna appy is AMAZING I will probably come back for just that specifically. So so so good. Our wings were okay, some pieces meatier than others, but we never got the two flavours we asked for only honey garlic which kind of sucked, but I chose not to say anything as I kind of got the feeling she was new. \n","\n","We ordered   martinis which were very good, a bit pricey  $ per drink, but super yummy! only complaint being some were filled to the top while others looked a bit like they weren't full drinks. \n","\n","Unfortunately I think we had a new server as our meals didn't come out correct either. I ordered the freight burger and my man ordered the ribs. When we got it his ribs had turned into fish :( I think the server punched it in wrong, possibly hastily as I am a server as well so noticed when she was cut and doing side duties. We were at that point taken over by a new server who seemed more senior who frankly fixed our not perfect experience. She Offered a Caesar salad for my man while we waited for his ribs so he had something to eat as well instead of just watching me eat mine which was nice n made the wait not as long. Oddly I think they add salt to their parmesan in their salads though.. As my bf is a salt nazi and didn't really like it because of that. I didn't mind though.. But I agree it was a touch salty. The ribs though.. When they came, boy they were worth the wait! \"Way better than the keg\" is what my man said and I had to agree. The sauce & flavour is mouth watering and you don't even need to bite into them as the meat was so tender it fell right off the bone as soon as you put it in your mouth. \n","\n","The ribs made our night! Our new server was sweet and attentive and filled us in on their buy   get one free meal cards which I thought was a great idea to get people to come back. I still tipped generously as our second server made such an effort to \"fix\" our table she was passed off.\n","\n","We definitely will be coming here again! Hopefully we get someone like our   server instead of our first lol\n","This review is from my visit to Vancouver at the end of March  . I came to this place for two reasons-to try the dim sum and get the Alaskan King Crab. \n","\n","This is a very big place an in addition to the street parking there is a parking garage with an elevator so it's easy for handicapped persons too. I was very fortunate to be taken care of by Cedric Ip who is a supervisor but gave me excellent personal service as if I was royalty. He recommend getting only one dim sum dish since we were getting an Alaskan King Crab which is obviously big.\n","\n","We got an order of har cow while waiting for our giant sea creature. This was our first har cow in Vancouver and they were fantastic- the best I've ever had and that says a lot. They were huge with sweet and tender shrimp and the right amount of sesame oil. It turns out that all three places we tried har cow in Vancouver including Richmond were just as big and fantastic such that I have determined Vancouver to be the Har Cow Capitol of the world!...at least best in North America as I have only been to The Philippines before and they weren't that good there.\n","\n","\n","Cedric suggested the crab be prepared in two ways which is what we went with: \n","\n"," . The \"knuckles\"(where the legs connect to the body) were prepared salt/pepper style that is lightly breaded and fried with jalapeno slices. \n","\n"," . The remaining crab i.e., legs were steamed with garlic butter.\n"," \n","Both preparations were fantastic and cooked perfectly. The meat from this crab was the most succulent and sweet meat unlike any other Alaskan King Crab I've ever had. Also what was obvious is that the meat was not too salty as is often the case- again just the sweetest meat I've had. \n","\n","Cedric picked us out a \"small\" crab that was   pounds as it was just for me and my girlfriend. While this was expensive (  Canadian dollars for   live Alaskan King Crab) it was well worth it for taste and experience. I think some staff were placing bets to see if we could finish it-(my gf is a petite Japanese girl) I proudly say there was nothing but shells left. It was so good we just could not stop eating the sweet monster from the deep cold Alaskan waters.\n","\n","Another supervisor suggested a nice sweet wine which perfectly complimented the crab and Cedric recommended the Mango crepe whipped cream to finish off our king sized meal.\n","\n","There were so many place to try I regret I was able to go back and try more of their dim sum if the har cow is that good what other dim sum goodies to they make great? I also wanted to try their apparent other specialty fried quail. \n","\n","I imagine I'll be back to Vancouver...in stretch pants...and will definitely come back here. I think this place is a must to eat at and experience.\n","Lido Restaurant  is located on Hazelbridge way between Parker Place and Aberdeen Mall and next door to Cafe de Waraku (click) .

Everyone who watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi would undoubtedly be swallowing their saliva right now just from reading the title of the documentary.  However, with Japanese restaurants opening up at almost every turn in Vancouver, the quality of many Japanese restaurants has become the likes of McDonald and Burger King; with the purposes of being fast, cheap, and filling while ignoring the senses.  \n","\n","Having said that, my girlfriend and I finally decided to try the one that my brother and his wife, foodies themselves, suggested a while ago.  Kiriri is a small, but well decorated Japanese restaurant that sits at a very unnoticing corner of Blundell and Garden City, Richmond.  Unless recommended, it's unlikely that people would pass there, let alone sit down and order.  Before I describe the incredibly delicious, fresh, and well balanced texture and flavours that made my senses go tingling and stomach go yum yum, let's see if I can do justice to the food by saying \"mnn... (yes, it is a sound), mnn... (louder), mnn... (LOUDER), YES, OH YES!\"  \n","\n","Our appetizers were tempura and Ankimo (monkfish liver).   The liver had a very smooth texture followed by a not so powering fishiness aftertaste, which tasted similar to Ikura fish eggs.  This dish is probably one those either you like or you hate it type of dish.  I liked it and I could even imagine eating the Ankimo like a meat pate on top of warm toasted bread.  The tempura was crispy with non-oiliness after taste.  They selected a variety of vegetables including egg plants, a big chunk of onion and carrots.  \n","\n","My main course was the Chirashi.  What separates a good and a bad Japanese restaurant can be seen in the way they make the rice and cut the fish.  The sashimi was fresh and was cut perfectly.  The salmon and the tuna were tender and juicy, while the squid and hokkigai were just enough chewiness.  Contrary to what many Japanese restaurant sell where the sashimi was just out of the freezer, tasteless with no texture or have been left out for long, my bowl of Kiriri Chirashi was heaven.  Combine that with a the well cooked rice that is mixed with a slight hint of vinegar, all I can say is you better not be looking at my Chirashi bowl, get your own!\n","\n","I am a big fan of saba and mackerel due its distinct smell and flavour.  We got the saba battera and miso mackerel.  The pressed saba sushi again had very mouthwatering rice with full intensity saba slice.  A plus on their originality was the added herbaceous and minted leaf, but just so happened that I found it to be overpowering and took away some of the saba flavour.  Nevertheless, you can see they put in the extra thought and effort for everyone to enjoy the dish.  The miso mackerel was also well cooked.  There was enough saltiness, creaminess and miso flavour, and the fish was cooked to just enough softness without going to the dry side.  Combining the miso mackerel with my chirashi rice....need I say more?  Unless you are a vegetarian, don't tell me you are not drooling right now.  \n","\n","We got two sushi rolls: The Great Negitoro and the Mango Scallop Rolls.  Again, you can tell they put in the extra efforts when they wrapped the sushi with coloured outer wrap and put them on the plate in an appetizing manner.  One piece, two pieces, three pieces....like a train going into a tunnel, except they won't ever come out...WUAHAHAHA.  The Negitoro could probably use a bit more green onion or perhaps have some spiciness or lemon to bring out the fish flavours a bit more.  I really enjoyed the mango on the mango scallop roll as it added the slightly sour flavour to augment the very slightly sweet and mineral scallop.  Dare I say that a sip of Pinot Gris or Riesling is in the order?  \n","\n","We debated about having desserts, but still decided to try their green tea tiramisu and black sesame creme brulee (with fruits platter).  We were so glad that we tried their desserts.  I am not a fan of tiramisu, but combination of creamy texture and the intense matcha with rum aroma and flavour was enough for me to have a couple bites.  The black sesame creme brulee was made inside the lid of the miso soup bowl while the fruits were laid out presentably inside the bowl.  The creme brulee was so smooth, creamy, milky and the taste of black sesame lasted for so long after each bite.  At the end of the dinner, all I wanted to do was lick the lid... and I almost did.  Who knew I would ever like creme brulee?\n","\n","Overall, I would say that food at Kiriri is definitely VERY delicious, reasonably priced (relatively compare to other comparable level of Japanese restaurants, like Ajisai, and Ichiro), and surprisingly original with startling discovery in every dish both in terms of flavour and texture.\n","River Rock Location Night Market:\n","\n","Pros: It \"use to be\" part of Richmond's culture back in the day when Nightmarket was hosted at Lansdowne mall and it was free entry and open.

The parking lot isn't even paved, it's a dusty industrial makeshift gravel lot.  Your car or motorcycle WILL get dirty and so will your shoes. The stage shows are half assed.  They put random volunteer or under paid desperate performances.  Terrible singing / music / not so talanted shows that will have you covering your ears as you walk by.  The stalls are uninteresting and selling overpriced Ebay china junk, don't expect any warranties to be valid here..The food stalls are not placed in a manner where it can handle the flow of traffic (people).  When a stall is performing poorly and has a lineup, the lineup will block the entire walkway. Poor design.  The washrooms are horrendous, the rubbish bins are still over flowing. The floors are dirty. This location is running over capacity, not sufficient to efficiently handle this much people. There really is no emergency exits. If there is a catastrophe, you can guarantee you will be run over by the mob or burned to death. Planner, designer, and manager need to be fired. \n","There is also lack of seating in the dining area and in general. A lack of cleaners and staff.\n","\n","The night market is also responsible for congesting traffic north bound on No.  rd from Friday to Sunday starting in the late afternoons.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Print Material and Ad Critique (Coupon Booklet / Passes);\n","\n","The graphic design and the print material is horrendous.   They definitely spent a lil bit of $ on printing out coupon booklets and ads while advertising that you save $  through using their coupons.  But you'll have to spend over $ .  They actually have a coupon that says \"Spend over $ \" to redeem this coupon. \n","\n","The reality is most of the coupons are save   cents here and there or  % off but you have to spend a ridiculous amount to use the coupons. Most of the coupons are for the food stalls that are selling extremely overpriced junk food and you'll get some random coupon for a tire change.\n","\n","The design firm or designers need to be fired, the logo branding and design is hardly appealing, it's almost childish.  Looks like they hired students and didn't pay them enough. They failed to follow a brand standard across the booklet, so it looks like a mashup of coupons from random budget businesses.   The photography looks like it's been done by a cellphone by an amateur photographer, again they didn't follow brand standards or photography standards.\n","\n","\n","\n","Overall impression:  Failure  by Epic proportions.\n","\n","\n","If you are a tourist and never EVER been to a \"RICHMOND\" Night Market, you should try it once only to be disappointed.  Because if you want the real thing, go visit Mong Kok (womens street)  in Hong Kong.\n","Perhaps I am living on a different planet from the rest of Yelp because I was supremely disappointed with Romilano's. Oh where, oh where should I begin. \n","\n","I work from home, so by the time  :  had rolled around I was starving and ready for a quick meal. Since I intended to get back to work right after eating, I decided to order an Oliva Funghi pizza with a side of cheesy bread.\n","\n","Around   minutes after I ordered, a very prompt, courteous and efficient delivery lady handed me my order. When I opened the pizza box, I was floored. The pizza looked amazing and had a generous amount of spinach on top (which I paid extra for, in addition to the roasted garlic). But when I picked up a slice, it limply hung in my hands.\n","\n","Now I'm no expert, but I thought thin crust pizza was supposed to be...y'know, crispy?  I don't have thin crust pizza often (if ever) but everyone who loves it always talks about how the crispness of the crust is the best part.\n","\n","Considering I hadn't eaten since yesterday night, I told myself the hunger had gotten to me: I was making a big deal out nothing. It was time for me to just chill and enjoy the damn pizza. 'All of yelp can't be wrong,' I muttered to myself, 'This is probably great pizza, I'm just a savage who doesn't know what good thin crust pizza should taste like.' But alas, even as I was listening to my internal pep talk, I felt something yellow and greasy pool in my pizza-wielding hand.\n","\n","Oil! And LOTS of it. Snaking its way down to the hardwood floor from the single slice I held in my hand. When I looked over at the box, I saw the huge stain pooling around the pizza. It even got on my table (somehow escaping through the bottom of the cardboard pizza box). I wish I were kidding when I tell you that this pizza was the greasiest, oiliest pizza I have ever had in my life.\n","\n","After having two slices, I could feel the oil churning around in my stomach. It wasn't a pleasant feeling. Obviously, pizza is oily and greasy. But thin crust pizza is supposed to be less oily then your regular, token Pizza Hut Panormous.\n","\n","The breadsticks were skinny, sad little things. They had a nice, delicious garlic flavour when I took a bite (a definite plus), but the cheese was severely lacking (a travesty when the menu calls them \"Cheesy Bread\"). \n","\n","I wasn't expecting them to be smothered in cheese (because this is an Italian style pizza place, not an American one), but I would have liked to taste some cheese in there. The breadsticks were definitely on the dry side. They looked so delicious on the menu too, but honestly? The   pieces were not worth the $ .  I paid for them (I could have had cheesier breadsticks from Little Caesars).\n","\n","The two stars you see above you have been given purely because of the fact that the owners of Romilanos seem like a very earnest, very hardworking couple. I was going to order my meal via skipthedishes, but Romilanos offered a very reasonable $ .  delivery fee, so I ordered straight from them instead. \n","\n","On the whole, I paid $  for a pizza that I didn't even enjoy. I could have gotten something edible from Domino's for a lot cheaper (something I would have enjoyed a lot more). But the fact remains that Romilano's offers a WIDE variety of toppings that will definitely appeal to people looking for Italian-style pizza.\n","\n","As for me, I'm avoiding thin crust pizza from now on. American style pizza all the way.\n","The worst dining for   experience EVER!!!!  I've been going to this restaurant for over   yrs. and food used to be amazing. It used to be my favorite restaurant for Sichuan food. Past few years the food's been going downhill, but still good enough, until I ate there last night. \n","\n","So, I went there around   pm and ordered about   or    dishes including their crab which I get most occasions. When the crab came out, it looked very small and didn't look right. So, I counted the legs and found   claws and   legs total. There were   legs missing. I don't even mind missing leg. As I tasted the crab, it didn't smell that fresh. I didn't want to make a big deal, and just ate it because I didn't want to embarrass my friend. In my mind I knew I got a dead crab that's been dead for awhile. Normally, they bring out the crab live on a pan for you to inspect and approve before cooking. This time they just brought out the cooked crab. Even if they bring it out live, I've seen restaurants change it in the kitchen. I knew  % it wasn't the one in the tank as I eat tons of crab and I know by taste and texture. As matter of fact I looked at the tank and saw about   in there before. When I looked at the tank again it looked same as before, and I don't remember anything swishing around the tank as We were sitting   tables away. The meat was little mushy this time and off tasting. But anyhow I kept to myself. \n","\n","The total bill was $  with no drinks, which I expected. I went up to pay the bill, and asked the lady who I think is the owner, how much they charge for the crab. She said its $ , which was stated on the bill. So I asked her how much per pound? Which is how we're normally charged in Chinese restaurants. She said $  for one any size, which doesn't make any sense. I told her the crab was very small and not fresh, hoping she caught on to what I was implying. She immediately walked into the kitchen, and I thought was going to talk to the chef, but when I sat back down at my table, she never came back. There was no sorry, or that crab is fresh because it was from tank, or anything. \n","\n","So, at this point I'm getting more pissed off after bad crab. Normally I'm a generous tipper with good service or food, and still tip fair share even with bad food or service. This is the first time I didn't want to tip. So, I left $  cash on the table and walked out hoping she would know why. \n","\n","So, this next event is what prompted me to write a review. As we were walking to the car, I hear the owner calling us, and as I walked back toward her, she says \"excuse me why didn't you leave a tip?\"\n","Now, this really pissed me off even more. I explained to her about the crab in detail, and she never once defended anything about the crab and never a sorry about anything. I told her she served me a dead crab and walked away. \n","\n","They want to rip me off on my meal, and chase me to parking lot to ask for tip????? PLEASE. HOW LOW CAN THEY GO?\n","\n","If you ever eat here, make sure they bring out a live crab from tank to show you, so you can make sure you get the same crab when it's cooked and not switched in kitchen. They may fool some customers sometime, but not all.\n","What can I say about this place that already hasn't been said?\n","\n","How about David Wang being a freaking God in Chinese cuisine?\n","\n","Yes, God...with a capital G, because I might just start a new religion called Wangism (get your mind out of the gutter...get it out! now!). Service is celebrated everyday and your sacrement is to eat a basket of xiao long bao. Jesus Christ...I mean...David Wang! I'd have millions if not billions of followers. It would start a new utopia and I'd finally teach the world to sing in perfect harmony (Coke you owe me...).\n","\n","If I start with any of the dishes, I'll start with my least favourite, not because it wasn't good, but because the others kicked me, rudely in the lychee nuts with flavour, this one at least asked me politely before it did it. This one, the Chicken with Peanuts, was spicy, crispy,  -spice, garlicky delicious and sang \"Dontcha wish your girlfriend was hot like me\" on my tongue. Yes, Spicy Chicken With Peanuts, I do, I do wish she was. It's ok my love, we'll be together soon and you can do your flavour burlesque on my taste buds.\n","\n","The next dish was Pork Cheeks with vegetable. With such a pedestrian name you don't expect much, but then it decides to bend you over a flavour bin and ravish you before leaving you with it's deep and delicious, sticky brown sauce all over your face.  \n","\n","The last dish...oh dear ever-loving David Wang...the last dish.\n","\n","I'll say it slowly so you get the full effect. Xiao. Long. Bao.\n","\n","It took me   tries to say it with the cute waitresses laughing at my clumsy, fumbling  Western mouth destroying their native tongue (I hope that gets me in with them in a Simple Jack/\"He's harmless because he's retarded\" sort of way. Yeah, I'm shameless, I'll go full retard if it gets me laid)\n","\n","Xiao long bao. Ohhh xiao long bao. The bastard love child of a steamed bun, dumpling and soup. Now I've had xiao long bao before, but there are times when you eat something that shows you that you've never truly experienced that food before. This was one of those moments. the wrapping, delicate yet held together enough for my clumsy chopsticks skills, the meat was light but the texture just resistant enough, and the broth, of my god, the broth. Promise me, promise me when I die that you'll float me on a funeral pyre of these dumplings down a river of this broth.\n","\n","David, adopt me, or at least get your Dad to, and teach me everything he taught you. We could be brothers, and have bunk beds! and be best buddies! David? David??\n","\n","Ok well while your getting that restraining order, keep those ambrosial culinary experiences coming. I'll order by phone and have my surrogate pick it up.\n","\n","Oh yeah, and this is on the pricier side of Chinese cuisine, but seriously, if you're not willing to spend the extra to get food made by a God, then I pity and lament you.\n","\n","Yes, I said it, pity and lament.\n","One of Richmond's best Japanese restaurants. Japanese food, made with Japanese (and local) ingredients, served by the dedicated hands of Japanese people; what more can one ask for.\n","\n","Looking from the outside, surrounded by a bike shop, a flower shop, and various other Asian establishments in a small plaza, one might assume on first judgement that Seto Japanese restaurant is nothing but a stereotypical hole-in-the-wall type of place. That's certainly what I thought when I first came here. But once you open the front door, you're usually immediately greeted by a smiling hostess or server as you walk past a small replica of a Japanese rock garden to the front counter. The sushi chefs behind the counter will always greet you as you pass by on your way to your seat. This is followed immediately by freshly poured hot tea or water to your table at your request as you begin to flip through the menu.\n","\n","Here are some reasons why Seto is getting a  -star from me.  ) the staff are kind and friendly, and you can usually tell from the genuine way they interact with you and check on you throughout your visit, always automatically filling your tea cup whenever it runs out;  ) the food is amazing - and  ) the price, I would say, is absolutely reasonable for what you get, especially combos like, for example, the Ume sushi set - $  for a well-made California roll and six assorted nigiri sushi. You can order anything from cuts of blue fin tuna to perfectly fried tempura, both traditional and westernized sushi rolls of all sorts, and even some ramen options, all of which you can't go wrong with.\n","\n","On an average visit by myself, I spend roughly $ .  after tips on about   -   nigiri sushi pieces (cause that's how I roll) and sometimes I also get a tenzaru soba which is about $ . . Some nigiri sushi I would recommend anyone to try are the uni, unagi, anago, ikura, and tamago. Portion sizes are on point. Also, it's worth mentioning that Seto is one of the only well-known Japanese restaurants I've found in Richmond where they actually put a little bit of wasabi in for you, in between the rice and fish which is how nirigi sushi is supposed to be served, so watch out if you don't like wasabi! \n","\n","Another thing that I really like that kind of sets Seto apart from other restaurants is the layout of the restaurant. Inside, unless you sit at the sushi bar, you'll usually be seated in booths which give you lots of privacy as you enjoy your meal. It's like you're stepping into your own little world where it's just you and your food with no outside distractions. This is my opinion, though, as I understand that some people don't like this kind of layout.\n","\n","I don't really have anything bad to say about Seto to be completely honest. A couple years ago when I first visited, I managed to find a small bone in one of the pieces of salmon sashimi I had ordered, but I let that go because I understand that sometimes people miss things and nobody's perfect all the time. That, and the food was delicious hence why I'm finally writing a review about this place after my most recent visit, years later. Whether you're having a dinner party or you're on a date or you're just in the mood to treat yourself to some good Japanese food, Seto will treat you right every time.\n","This is a sad day; without going into the minutiae of what went wrong, and risk this becoming a rant rather than a critical review - I'll try to keep this to the point, and informative (hopefully!)\n","\n","My husband's (then boyfriend) family introduced me this restaurant many years ago, as one of our first family outings, so it's always held a sentimental place in my heart.  For my husband (A.), it's been where his family always went to get fish and chips, and therefore held even more memories, and a permanent placeholder in his stomach.  \n","\n","Why Shady used to be great:\n"," . Fresh seafood, used in a great variety of west coast entrees (nothing too innovative, but always tasty comfort food Ex. Fish and chips; lobster ravioli)\n"," . Large, generous portions.  I still remember that first meal with Granny, where she got full on one crab cake.\n"," . Friendly service, a nice family, even low key date night, atmosphere\n","\n","A few years ago, we moved to Toronto, and Shady was no longer a part of our regular fare.  We tried many a fish and chip places, but A's conclusion was that it didn't compare to Shady.  Our friend, and local Steveston resident, warned us that Shady's reputation had taken a nose dive after our departure, but A. would hear none of it.  Finally, we booked a trip home, and Shady was on A's \"Must\" list for the week.\n","\n","Why Shady is no longer great;\n"," . Reduced menu choices.  Although they got rid of the Lobster ravioli prior to our departure to the East, I noticed that nothing creative has been added to the menu as a replacement.  Most of the menu items seem to just be seafood in it's \"pure\" form, which I suppose, if the seafood is fresh, is really the best way to showcase it - so, I can't necessarily fault them there.  I will just say, I struggled this time, to find something to order.  The oddest thing was, that they got rid of A's fish and chips selection:   pieces Halibut and Chips.    piece is still available.  And   pieces was available for all the other types of fish, but not the Halibut.  Out of curiousity, we asked about it, and were told that the restaurant \"uses a very expensive cut of halibut\". (???)\n"," . TINY portions:\n","a) Halibut,   piece.  For  . , A hoped that his one piece would satisfy (he wasn't offered the option to add the \"off-menu\" second piece).  When it came, a look of distress crossed his face.  The fish was roughly the size of a McDonald's fish filet patty.  \n","b) One of the reasons I struggled to find something to order is because I wasn't that hungry, and was looking for something small, or at least something I wouldn't mind taking home.  I settled on the Lobster Mac and Cheese; if my memory was correct, the pasta dish would be large enough to serve as my lunch the next day as well.  Well, leftovers was not a problem for me - when the LBC came, it was honestly served in a ramekin.\n"," . Serivce left something to be desired. Our waitress was clearly the nicest person working there; she was friendly and attentive when she had the chance, but was totally overwhelmed.  From what I could see, she was probably the only staff that was working?  Everyone else seemed to spend a lot of time chatting and standing around.  One such server was designated to bring us our food, and A. made the error of asking her for vinegar for the fries, and a refill on his diet coke.  End of story, we had to re-ask our original waitress for the diet coke, and A. actually went outside to the patio to get his own, darn vinegar.\n","\n","My apologies - this ended up being sort of picky, even though I ventured not to make it so.  Alas - the rumours of Shady's downfall are true.  After years of it being a nostalgic favourite, we probably won't return the next time we are in BC.  As for A., have you even seen a grown man's heart break over fish and chips?  I have, and it isn't pretty.  The whole drive home, he raged about setting up his own Yelp profile, just so he could write a scathing review - in the end, the anger peetered out, and he was left just sort of sad.  Shady - I just can't forgive you for breaking my husband's heart.\n","So apparently there's no good Chinese food in Paris and   siu mai will set you back   Euros when it's only about $  here. Or so says my friend who's back in town after about six months there.\n","Naturally, she wanted to eat good Chinese food before going home and tonight we landed at Yue Delicacy -- the \"Best Chinese Upscale winners of Vancouver Magazine's   Annual Restaurant Awards\".\n","\n","Right off the bat, they scored bonus points over most Chinese restaurants for the following:\n","- Host at the front door. Who speaks English. None of that waiting-around-till-someone-acknowledges-you-so-you-can-ask-about-a-reservation and watching-people-coming-in-after-you-get-served-while-you-are-still-ignored that can happen at other places.\n","- Clean washrooms. That look like hotel washrooms.\n","\n","Slight loss of points for the menus which have English translations, but not quite enough. When the price reads \"$  / unintelligible Chinese characters\", as a diner you really, really, want to know what the heck those Chinese characters mean. No pictures either.\n","\n","We tried a bunch of stuff and overall the food was really decent, without looking too oily or sauced. Some items:\n","\n","Deep Fried Whole Squab ($ . ?)\n","- Total amount of meat less than one leg and thigh from KFC. Not worth it.\n","\n","Peking Duck   ways (on the bill it shows as \"Beijing Duck  \")\n","- Didn't seem too special. Pretty standard.\n","- The dish made from the duck meat looked like a simple stir-fry. Looks like a lot but if you look closely, chopped up onions (?) make up a good amount of this. A bit lacking in tastiness (but not too salty either) but there's a lot of Hoisin (?) sauce for you to top up the flavour.\n","\n","Deep Fried Milk Curd (?)\n","- The dish is mostly a stir-fry of snow peas, a bit of mushroom, and a lot of reasonably fat prawns.\n","- The deep fried lumps are coated in batter. Sweet, and you can further sweeten these by dipping them in sugar.\n","- I had a slight bitter aftertaste from these but my fellow diners said they didn't have the same. Hmm.\n","- Overall, not as interesting or tasty as it sounded. And didn't really go well with the rest of the dish. They could've done this as a dessert.\n","\n","Sweet Taro Soup\n","- One of three free desserts! Looked like everyone got this and it definitely didn't show on the bill.\n","- Simple, sweet, cloudy-milky soup with some sort of small pearls and cubes of taro.\n","- Simple and tasty.\n","\n","Almond Roll\n","- Slightly sweet translucent jelly-like wrap with slivers of almond.\n","- OK tasting, made better by being part of the free dessert lineup.\n","\n","Fried thingie with honey, sesame seeds, and coconut (?)\n","- Oily tasting fritters of ... I-don't-know-what that's really just there to carry the honey and other stuff sprinkled unevenly on top.\n","- More free dessert. Hmm...\n","\n","Overall, taste was okay to good, and they got bonus points for amenities and quality of service (which is still inferior to The Change, which is clearly expecting to cater to a more Caucasian demographic).\n","\n","We ordered a total of four things and our bill came to just over $  after tax and before tip. For three persons, and NO cheap carbs to make dinner more filling, we ended up at $ /person before tip, and enough leftovers for two very full takeout boxes, so price is really decent if you go in a group.\n","\n","Tea was free, of course and they were proactive about topping it up -- we didn't need to open the top of the pots to signal we needed a hot water refill. That's still more brownie points for their service.\n","Also nice are mobile screens that can give dining parties relative privacy in the smallish room.\n","There are thousands of restaurants in Metro Vancouver, but I always find myself coming back to this one. This is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Canada, even though I've been to similar restaurants that were better in the United States. It's like a silly little guilty pleasure I have. When visiting from Seattle, the first place I ever want to stop at after crossing the border is Sun Sui Wah. It's a bright, clean, and spacious dim sum restaurant that offers high quality food and a unique dining experience.\n","\n","Probably the most obvious difference of this place from other restaurants is that you order using scantrons similar to the ones you filled out with number two pencils in school. Well here, you use them to tell the staff what you want. The scantron sheet lists the menu items and you use the pencil to fill in the bubble (it's more like a rectangle) that corresponds to the quantity of the item you want. If you want three shumais, you find shumai on the scantron and darken the space for \" .\" I have never seen any other restaurant do this, but if these people want to run their business this way, I can't say I have a problem with it.\n","\n","Prices are pretty straightforward. \"Small\" dishes go for $ .  each, \"medium\" ones are priced at $ . , and \"large\" ones are $ . . Like many other dim sum restaurants, you don't have any control over the size of the dishes. The sizes are all predetermined and the scantron tells you what size each one is. I'm not aware of any size here that's inaccurately labeled, but the prices are a little high, Canadian or U.S. For the food here, though, it's a fair tradeoff, and the hordes of people that pack this place during lunchtime seem to suggest that the Canadians feel the same way.\n","\n","One of my personal favorites here is the steamed tofu skin roll. It's apparently tofu skin wrapped around meat, dripping with juice, and very flavorful. Chicken feet are similarly juicy and the tendon inside them is delicious. The shumai is rich and exquisite, and topped with bright orange fish roe. Another excellent dish is the har gow (shrimp bonnets), steamed shrimp wrapped inside starch. They don't do anything unusual or special with these, but they taste so good anyway that it's hard to care about how they could be made less plain. These are all very familiar dim sum dishes that, while a tad expensive, surpass much of what you could find elsewhere.\n","\n","Among the less well-known dishes is the fried taro croquette, basically just taro inside a wispy intricate outer breading (I actually don't know exactly what it is). I like that dish, along with roasted barbecue pork pastries covered with sesame seeds, because they sort of blur the line between the meal and dessert. There is a hint of sweetness to them and they go great toward the end of the meal. Actual dessert items like egg tarts are here, too. There's so much good stuff here that if you order right, you'll likely be full before you get to the desserts. For any kind of restaurant, this is a great sign. The prices could reasonably be a little lower, but the food is almost as good as it gets.\n","Being from HK where restaurants have supremacy in fine dining, it makes me quite a restaurant/food snob.  That being said, you can bet my reviews are very critical.\n","\n","Shanghai River is managed by Cantonese speaking staff while the waiters and bussers are Mandarin speaking for obvious reasons, they speak some English and the menus are translated in English as well to cater to Westerners.  With that said, I expect a certain level of quality in the food and service.\n","\n","Menu Design / Photography:  / \n","Menu Quality  / \n","\n","As a Designer and Photographer I was impressed at the aesthetic quality of the menu at first glance, design setup was nice, the texture of the thick suede texture pages and beautiful photography seemingly by a professional budget photographer. However one that is using a cheap or vintage optics. Menu items were poorly arranged and not concise, items no longer in service were covered up by a cheap (discontinue) sticker. There are vegetarian options.\n","\n","Restaurant setup, decor, cleanliness :  / \n","\n","Crammed spaces, tiny waiting area and noisy side rooms with a lack of sound proofing where they jam a few more tables in there. This is the norm in many restaurants as such. Such rooms are disconnected from the main dining area which mean less service. The decor is decent at best, its business is still young.  The tea and teapot is nice, but they didn't ask which tea I want and just gave us some random green tea. Almost all fine dining / seafood restaurants have a selection of teas.  Even restaurants on granville and main st that are cheaper have selections.\n","The chinaware is cheap and rough. the floors and carpet is dirty, the corners have food debris. Poor management and poor cleanliness.  Dirty outside means very dirty inside (kitchen).\n","\n","Appetizers:  / \n","\n","Appetizers pricing from $  all the way up to $ .  They have a few expensive options but won't let you bundle it in their appy bundle deal. The problem is it's all in the same page of the menu and you wouldn't know this until it's time to order. We picked   appetizers. They were decent at best. The flavors is somewhat authentic, but the duck meat was cheap quality, the texture was tough and nasty. The appetizers are worth trying and the value is decent for what you pay for.\n","\n","Main Courses:  / \n","\n","With items ranging from $ -$ .  You have expensive seafood to the cheap terrible quality \"Shanghai dumplings\" named \"Shanghai pork bun\"(direct translation but incorrect usage).  Shanghai dumplings is a speciality and any Chinese restaurant who fails at this pretty much loses  credibility in the kitchen. Shanghai dumplings have pork stuffing and a soup base inside wrapped with supposedly hand made dumpling skin.  The dumpling skin seems fine but not the best. The  pork used in the dumpling is of such terrible quality that there is a nasty pig stink. If you're a meat lover you probably cant tell the difference between pig and chicken stink. It is very very fowl flavor that usually signals poor quality non organic meat. The duck meat was terrible all night and had a stale scent as well. It is sad because again, cabbage wrap is such a basic dish, yet if you fail to select good quality meat and treat it properly you fail the entire entre.\n","\n","Washrooms:  / \n","\n","Water, debris and tp on the floor, water all over counter signals a lack of maintenance from the \"clean team\" during service hours. Good restaurants have cleaners clean on the hour.

The staff spoke in broken ENG or broken Canto.  For this kind of setup and pricing it is not satisfactory to have communication problems, this can yield to incorrect orders etc.  Luckily our table tonight had fluent speakers in Mandarin, Canto and English to ensure orders were taken down correctly. The service was intermittent on the slow end. The restaurant was busy, but thats no excuse for us to have to flag down a waitress just to fill our teapot. This is standard service principle. If your customers have to flag you down for a refill, your restaurant is poorly managed. Usually, the practice is to open the teapot top. This already signals empty pot and service staff is suppose to keep an eye for such. We had to wait on arrival even with a reservation.\n","\n","Kitchen speed:  /  \n","\n","For a busy night they performed satisfactory. The food came out in a timely matter but was not as hot as they should be.\n","\n","Payment:  / \n","\n","Was quick.  Of course by   when its closing time and there really isn't any body left, taking your money is the quickest thing they're good at.\n","\n","We left a  % tip regardless of poor quality experience because we felt the service staff was overworked. They were however friendly. \n","Although, for Chinese restaurants it is an absolute standard to never go above  %\n","\n","Overall, there are cheap and expensive solutions in this restaurant, it's worth a try o\n","I've been waiting to try this place out for a while since we visited Korea last spring and the BBQ there was just good (but so pricey). Before we arrived I'll admit we were thinking about not even going because of all the bad reviews, and especially since Sura (my fav KBBQ) was so close by too, but we decided to just give it a shot anyway. So we popped by on a Friday night around  : , we had to wait about an hour to get a seat. I'll give you fair warning, it is extremely smokey in there! There isn't enough ventilation so once you leave your entire body reeks of BBQ smell. Aside from that, I was totally surprised! It was amazing! The quality of meat here is definitely on a whole nother level! You can taste the difference compared to other KBBQ restaurants. \n","\n","We ordered: \n","Pork Skirt Meat With Five Flavour $ \n","Marinated Beef Skirt $ . \n","Black Bean Noodles $ . \n","Japchae $ \n","Ddeokbokki with Noodles $ .  \n","\n","This was for   people, we ended up paying about ~$  before our tip? \n","I'll admit the prices are quite high for the meat dishes, but because we ordered so many sides, we were all content after our meal, and to spend only $  each, in hindsight its really not too bad.\n","\n","The Black Bean Noodles, Japchae, & Ddeokbokki are priced so low because they are actually portioned out to be for   person. They were really small! But they were all sooo delicious! I would even say that the Japchae here is better than at Sura and the Black Bean Noodles taste so authentic! They also put cheese on the Ddeokbokki, they were a little too spicy for me, but for anyone who loves spice, this dish is just amazing! \n","\n","The meat dishes were quite small as well and like I said, super pricey. But  when you take a bite into it, you can see why. The beef dish was probably one of my favourites, it just melt in your mouth. Usually I don't order pork at KBBQ because pork becomes tough so quickly since you have to cook it thoroughly, but since we wanted to order a platter so we could give the different cuts a try, we were all really surprised at how delicious the pork was, even after sitting on the grill for quite some time they were still very flavourful and tender. And the nice thing about this place too is that the staff actually cook everything for you! At the time that I was there, they were really on it! \n","\n","I would recommend to come when their soft opening is over, due to many of their items not being available right now! Overall I was really happy, I'm not sure why this place has such low ratings. The quality is totally different (in a good way) compared to other KBBQ places. \n","\n","Side Note: If I had to pick between Sura or Seorae, it would be very difficult because they are totally different. The quality of meat at both places are exceptional, but there is just a difference in the flavours at Seorae that I just can't put my finger on, you've at least got to try it once to know what I mean!\n","This is one of my favourite places to go for late night eats, or a late night snack after the gym! I prefer it over Matsuyama because of the larger menu, lower prices, and better tasting food. Just be aware that it will most likely be very busy, and with the small location, this means the possibility of no immediately available parking and a very likely  -  min wait time. Also, this means rushed service (they seem understaffed as well). \n","\n","I went here yesterday after we realized that the ramen place we wanted to try was closed. So of course we headed to Koto, our usual go-to after-gym spot. There were two parking spaces open, luckily, at about  :  pm. We put our name down and were   on the list, I believe, with a  -  min wait time estimate. I would say this was accurate.\n","\n","When you order, I would suggest knowing  % what you want to get because the owner lady will get impatient if you are still deciding. She can take orders really quickly electronically. \n","\n","We were pretty hungry so we got more items than usual. The final bill came to about $  for   people, I believe. Our usual orders are a salmon/toro sashimi, cones, mini-dons, and tako wasabi.\n","\n","The salmon/toro sashimi was good as usual. Toro is sooo delicious. Salmon is same as everywhere else. The slices for these are a little thin in my opinion but you get what you pay for.\n","\n","The cones are all $ .  and a great deal in my opinion. I would order just these if I were on a budget. I had a chopped scallop cone and also the kani cone. Kani is crab but the cone actually uses a tempura fried imitation crab piece with tobiko underneath and some cucumber. The chopped scallop cone was delicious.\n","\n","We also got tako wasabi, one of my favourites. It comes with a lot of seaweed and a small bowl of octopus in this slimy sauce. The trick is not to put too much inside the seaweed - that's why they give you so much - the wasabi can really attack your nose! This is from the regular menu, not the late night one.\n","\n","I got the salmon mentaiko mini-don and my friend got the spicy chopped scallop mini-don, $ .  each. She had no problem mixing her scallop with all the rice, but I ended up having some extra rice leftover. My don came with a huge blob of mayonnaise with the mentaiko which was surprisingly yummy and not too disgusting feeling. Although more filling, for the price I think two cones are a better deal :)\n","\n","We noticed a menu on the side of the table with grilled items, and my friend wanted the yaki nasu, grilled eggplant. It was very light - a good change to all the other stuff we got. Not much more to say about this other than it was $ . .\n","\n","We also shared a mini hotpot - nabeyaki udon. It came with one prawn tempura and a yam tempura. There was egg, broccoli, imitation crab, and vegetables. It was a good size and tasted like a typical nabeyaki udon. I think this was $ . . The picture I'll attach is half eaten - oops!\n","\n","Lastly, we got chicken karrage. This came as   pieces of small chicken wings / drumsticks. These were fried and seasoned and very juicy. for $ . , not too bad. I thought karrage normally comes as chicken chunks, but these are good too.\n","\n","Other items I've had before are the beef tataki, chopped scallop roll, mini sukiyaki hotpot, salmon carpaccio, tai carpaccio, spicy chopped scallop cone, agedashi tofu... I would not order the carpaccio again, they are all topped the same with mayo and onion and have less fish than other similarly priced items. The beef tataki is good but I think small as well. I am not a huge fan of tofu so this one was just okay. I think any variation of the mini hotpots, rolls, cones, and mini dons are a safe choice!\n","\n","I would definitely come back again. The service isn't amazing but I don't expect too much from a place like this. It's just good enough and no one is ever rude so that's fine. The food is priced well, the late night menu has an awesome variety, and it tastes so good! Late night forever!!\n","On my last day of my one day in Vancouver, I had plenty of time for my last meal in British Columbia. Glad my flight was at   in the afternoon instead of   and no time to eat before going to the airport. I had to visit one last mall before heading off to YVR. With all the Asians in Richmond, I guess I had to eat at the contrary, White Spot Restaurant in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.\n","\n","Located at the Richmond Centre Mall, you'll find the popular White Spot Restaurant. If you didn't drive here, you can take the train to Richmond-Brighhouse Station and walk across the street. Like the other Yelpers, White Spot reminds me of Denny's, just Canadian. It was Sunday and very busy at noon. I had no idea what White Spot was. When we were seated, I looked at the menu and looked very American or southern with their promotion of their fried chicken.\n","\n","There is a bar area, but have limited seating. I opted to sit in the main area. I didn't get our waitress' name. On my receipt it says, \"Bronwyn\". My friend was falling asleep since my birthday we were going across Vancouver. He got himself ton of coffee ($ . ) while I was still recovering from my hangover with free water. We both noticed that service was very slow to refill both our water and coffee. When we were ready to take our order, we got straight to business. My friend order Nats Heart Breakfast ($ . ) with an additional side of cole slaw ($ . ). I went very simple. I ordered the White Spot Clubhouse with multi-grain bread and endless fries ($ . ). Yes, ENDLESS FRIES\n","\n","Although I can't write the review for my friends order, I can definitely write about mine. The wait for our order is about   minutes. The restaurant started getting busy and usually means, its a popular spot. When we got our order, I dug right in. The White House Club is basically a BLT with chicken. I loved the cole slaw, but I wish there was more besides a small scoop. Half a sandwich was good enough, but I had to finish the other half since I wasn't going to take it with me on the plane. When I finished my first order of fries, I had to wait about   minutes for the waitress to come back. It was like they were avoiding my order. I did flag the waitress and got my french fries fast.\n","\n","The service was very slow, but the restaurant was busy. I thought there were a lot of employees, but it seemed it wasn't enough. When it was time to order, I was still getting accustomed to the employees bring the POS system to your table instead of them swiping the card at the counter. Its cool since you can select the percentage of the tip instead of trying to calculate in your head. I love how the receipt says about my extra fries, \"  more fries!!!\" I wonder if I had order another. What would it say? Perhaps someone can order if you visit?!\n","\n","You think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!\n","Sun Sui Wah Seafood Restaurant is a dim sum & seafood restaurant in Vancouver.  They're known for great dim sum and some unique seafood options (if they haven't run out). \n","\n","My Overall Rating -   Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n","\n","Atmosphere - Sun Sui Wah Seafood Restaurant is in a pretty non-descript area of Vancouver.  The parking is underground and goes pretty deep down.  Once you take the elevator up, you'll exit into a fairly large dining area.  On our weekend visit it was busy and bustling, and we thankfully had reservations so there was no wait.  In other words, it's a busy (good) Chinese restaurant.   Star.\n","\n","Service - What's interesting about how Sui Wah does its dim sum, is there are no carts.  You don't do any window shopping.  Instead you have to order everything off the menu.  So if you don't know what you like, you may be out of luck.  Service was just average.  We had to ask for water multiple times, and it was so busy it was difficult to flag down a server.  It's typical average Asian restaurant service.    /  Star.\n","\n","Food - We ended up ordering our typical dim sum items, and we're disappointed.  What's interesting is that the shu mai/har kow are huge.  All dim sum items were about  % larger than what I'm used to.  Some of our favorites:  pork short ribs, Chinese broccoli, rice cakes with shrimp, yellow cake, congee, egg custard.  One other item they have is Alaskan king crab. They'll bring a live one out to your table, take it back and cook it a number of ways:  claws, soup, fried rice.  If they are available, GET ONE.  Too bad it's not always available.      /  Star.\n","\n","Will I Return? - Yes.  If you've never been you should go.  I've been a number of times so my next visit will probably take me elsewhere.  But then again I may go just to get a crab.    Star.\n","\n","My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n","  Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n","  Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n","  Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n","  Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n","\n","Each Category can be given up to   star except food (  stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score\n","We had heard all about how Vancouver's Chinese food is as close to authentic Cantonese-style food you'd get in Hong Kong, so of course, we had to make a trip out to Sun Sui Wah (a famous restaurant back in HK)for some good eats.  I'm so, so, so glad that we did.  The food there is outrageously good and comparable to what you would have gotten at Daly City's Koi Palace before the crowds overwhelmed the kitchen and the quality went down.\n","\n","We were probably the youngest table in the dining room- most tables were local families out for their weekly diner or tourists there to try the Alaskan king crab.  The crab might very well be their signature dish, but at something close to $  a pound (each crab weighed an average of maybe   pounds), we decided that Alaskan king crab was priced quite a bit out of our range, considering there were only   of us and the American dollar really isn't what it used to be .  That didn't stop a table of Italian tourists from ordering it- the crab is taken out of its tank with great fanfare and brought to the table, where the tourists proceeded to pose for pictures with the great beast.\n","\n","As for us, we went with something a little closer to our budget (though everything is still pretty price-y)- a roast squab to share, a pound of live spotted prawns prepared deep-fried with salt and pepper, fried sea bass fillet with soy sauce, and a fried rice dish served with two sauces (one tomato with chicken shreds, the other a white egg sauce).  The roast squab came first- perfectly golden crisp skin on the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside.  The squab had an intense, liver-y flavor that was delicious and you couldn't help but gnaw at it to try getting every last tasty morsel.  The spotted prawns came next, which were absolutely delicious and worth every penny.  The prawns were supremely fresh- the flesh was sweet and succulent and a perfect counterpoint to the salty exterior.  Hands down, it was my favorite dish of the evening.  That's not to say the other two dishes weren't great- they were.  The sea bass was perfect in the light soy sauce- the fish flaky and tasty, and the sauce balanced just right to complement the fish.  As for the fried rice, it was phenomenal- the red tomato sauce reminded me completely of a dish I used to have in Hong Kong.  If I had my way, I would have brought cartons of that sauce back home with me to the Bay Area.  Instead, I had to content myself with the dish, the happy memories it brought back for my sister and I and enjoy the moment.\n","\n","The whole meal was a tad on the high side, but I would have gladly paid more.  The seafood was as fresh as advertised and the chefs there did a great job at making sauces that didn't overwhelm the delicacy of the seafood.  A definite must for any foodie visiting Vancouver- I know I can't wait for my return trip.\n","Somehow I wonder if this location has recovered from the Porsche going into it.... or the fact that the last tenant was in here so long with mediocre food. Let's get to the place that is now \"Baiyulan\" obviously they did not go to some different amended English friendly name this time, as this name has been carried many times, and oddly enough at a few places in the Lower Mainland. I was thinking, cool, they are taking up a better, more central location. They decided to keep the direct pinyin for the name and not be weird creative.\n","\n","This is the former Thai House location in Richmond, one where you have barely seen anyone in here, except last I hear a Porsche decided to go in there through the window.. and that was it. The setup is practically the same, with a minor touch-up on the renovation/refresh side. It is an odd configuration for a restaurant, but if you have been here before you will know what I mean. We came in on a Saturday, lunch time, and the staff is young, like this could all be their first jobs, the uniform is a simple logo'd t-shirt. The order form for lunch is like the old Baiyulan, a paper order sheet where you check things off and just give it to whichever server you can find zipping around. So we were originally sat at a table that could sit  , then we were asked to move to the corner so they could split the table to seat another table.. no problem.... however we also put our order in first, and how they received their order before us was quite puzzling. \n","\n","I do not know how cooked food beats non-cooked food to the table, but this is exactly how this all started. From my order of cold soy milk, to some cold pig ears and beef tripe, these were done way before, and yet next to us had their cooked food first... alright.  The cold plates were not bad, as they were both spicy, a little bit more spicy than I am used to, and both portions were a very fair size. We also ordered a savoury soy milk, that went to my cousin, I see they added quite a bit of seaweed in that one. The last thing to come was the XLB, you would think going into a place that practically is famous for this.. this would be a no question, knock it out of the park, only reason why you come to a place... type dish... well my friends, far beyond that.\n","\n","They couldn't even get the presentation right, as the   in a steamer, one was pretty crooked and off course. They looked alright, I wouldn't say the wrapping was overly thick, or paper translucent thin, but it was the meat that was the true let down. I would describe it as rubber hard like, clumped together, no bounce, something you would buy in the freezer section of a Chinese supermarket, one where it had the essence in shape, but clearly didn't taste like much, no matter how you cooked this thing. Also the fact they didn't bring us any dipping plates for the vinegar, or any strips of ginger after they gave us a dipping plate... the reason why I gripe about this is that the table next to us ordered the same XLB (after us.. yet they got it before) and they received a dipping dish with ginger strips.\n","\n","I do not know if this is the former owner of the other Baiyulan... but if it is I hope they right the ship fast or this one is going to be a memory in no time... especially with the competition already out there.\n","Overall rating of  .  based on two experiences-Dine-in and newly added to Justeat.ca Richmond (for take out). Pay attention to whether you want to order for delivery or pickup, apparently there's two different menus (?). I personally didn't analyze them both but if you switch from delivery to take out whatever you added to your cart gets deleted. Also note, phone them to confirm that your order hasn't already been sent off if you place a pickup. My order, apparently, was about to be sent off when I arrived. Luckily, I put a later pickup time taking into consideration of rush hour traffic. \n","\n","Service at this place is mediocre. Wouldn't say it's the best. Both for take out and dine-in. \n","\n","Food is definitely better eating in. I'd give it   stars but for take out I'd say  . Also depends on what you order. If it has deep fried tempura in your rolls or crispy crunch on top, they tend to get softened by the time you reach home. I do give them props for still trying to give the utmost effort in presentation and to put each roll in a separate box. So I do recommend dining in instead of taking out or else you can just take out from a less expensive sushi joint. \n","\n","Dishes/Sushi's I've tried: \n","\n","-Monkey Brain ( / -$ . ): Deep fried avocado with juicy crab meat and cooked tuna replacing the seed with spicy sauce. Super delicious and still tasted good when it arrived home. I didn't taste much crab meat to be honest. \n","\n","-Sexy Roll ( / -$ . ): Avocado, imitation carb, tuna, salmon, ebi, tamago  wrapped with thinly sliced cucumber instead of rice. This is what I call the carb-free roll. I had a similar roll at Sushi Mura and Mega sushi does it way better. It was nicely wrapped. Didn't fall apart and our roll was not drenched in sauce. Actually our sauces were put in a small container so we used it as a dip. \n","\n","-Paradise Roll ( / -$ . ): Deep fried california roll with seaweed salad, tobiko, asparagus, spicy mayo on top. Unfortunately, this roll didn't have the presentation it would have if we were to dine in and to me, the initial bite didn't wow me at all. But the flavour really came through having it as leftover. So my take would be that it has to be eaten when it's fresh so you get the deepfried-ness or cold so the flavours of the seaweed salad enhances the deep fried cali roll.\n","\n","-Cherry Blossom Roll ( . / -$ . ): Avocado, cucumber, imitation crab in a roll with salmon, avocado, apple sauce, caper, tobiko on top. Had higher expectations to this roll. The apple sauce don't go well with sushi and the caper had no effect at all. I'd skip this roll. But points for novelty.\n","\n","-Stanley Roll ( / -$ . ): Prawn tempura, cucumber in a roll with sliced avocado, spicy tuna, green onion, tobiko and yam flakes on top. This was one of the least appetizing roll for all of us. All I tasted was the avocado and presentation of roll when it came home wasn't that great.\n","\n","-Blue Ocean Roll ( . / -$ . ): red tuna, hamachi, salmon, radish sprout, avocado in soy wrap with tobiko. The fish in this roll was fresh and loved that they used soy wrap instead of the usual seaweed. But it wasn't anything mindblowing.\n","\n","-Romance Roll ( . / -$ . ): avocado, cucumber, imitation crab, radish sprout in a roll with red tuna and deep fried lotus root on top. Looks pretty but it tastes similar to the cherry blossom roll minus the apple sauce. \n","\n","-Big Boss Roll ( / -$ . ): Prawn tempura, cucumber, imitation crab, avocado in a roll with torched tuna, yam flakes, four sauces on top. Totally worth the price. You get lots of tuna on top and the yam flakes would have tasted so much better had it not have gotten soggy. Still one of my favourite out of the bunch.\n","\n","-Kiss me Roll ( . / -$ . ): Unagi, cucumber, avocado in a roll with redtuna, salmon, avocado on top. Looks very similar to the romance roll and honestly, it almost tasted the same. This one comes with a spicy sauce, if I remember right. \n","\n","-Tank Roll ( / -$ . ): Prawn tempura, salmon, tuna, tobiko, ebi, smoked salmon, imitation crab, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese in a roll. Simple look to it. Huge with almost everything you can possibly want. No sauce but still absolutely delicious. One roll would be enough to fill me. Glad we shared.\n","\n","-Sun Set roll ( / -$ . ): Cucumber, avocado, tuna in a roll with torched salmon, scallop on top with alfalfa. Tasty, but didn't really taste the scallop and didn't standout enough for the extra buck.\n","\n","-Godzilla bite ( / -$ . ): Deep fried seaweed and rice with tuna, salmon, torched spicy chop and alfalfa on top with special sauce. This is not a roll but rather a rice bed with sashimi on top if you will. Pretty interesting. Had this one at the restaurant, thus the presentation was lovely as well. \n","\n","-Beef Yakisoba ( / -$ . ): Ample beef but more veggies than meat. The noodles were ok. Not something I would order again. Served in a cast iron plate.\n","It's been awhile since I have been back at Manzo.  I remember often keeping this in the back of my mind that we need to go back for more Yakitori and sushi and stuff.  However, when the time comes, we seem to forget that this place is here and end up in Vancouver for Yakitori.\n","\n","(quick video of our last dine here:    )\n","\n","Why bother going all the way to Downtown Vancouver or Main street for overpriced skewers when you can get it just as easily here?  Sure parking can suck at times but it's still better than Vancouver!  The drive, the fuel, the getting ready, the drive back when you're full.\n","If you happen to live in this area or close by, why not come here?\n","I'm not talking about that big Manzo, I'm talking about this one. The original, the better version.  \n","\n","One thing we like about this place is that it is smaller, more personable and less American or Western like.  The coziness of the place with it's dark interior and wood and posters everywhere lends to a feeling that you could almost be in your local Izakaya watering hole in Japan somewhere, anywhere.  \n","\n","I can imagine one place in Japan where you're being served by pretty staff and the owners are Chinese Yakuza with their broken Japanese accents and gold chains, hanging out in the back table playing some drinking games while families are having their dine out up front.\n","Local salary people gathering for a meal before going home and starting work the next day.  Repeating their routine each week or even day by coming back.\n","\n","That's what this place brings to me.  Except the owners are not Yakuza and the customers, well, not really all Japanese.  This is Richmond so the patronage here will not be the same.  We did see a family having dinner with children and all. There were the odd business workers and a few dating couples taking Snap Chats and Instagrams during their meal while texting to others between sips of tea or plum wine and beer.\n","\n","You can get Japanese beer, but funny as it seems, a lot of local Japanese seem to prefer Kokane go figure.\n","\n","Each Yakitori dish we had was either a   star really really good or at the worst a   star but still good.  In some cases they had dishes that other Yakitori places didn't have, were better priced and came out just as fast piping hot and delicious.\n","\n","Heck if my two favourite Japanese gal pals liked this place as much as I did, then it's good enough for you.\n","\n","After writing this review, I hope I didn't release the Foodie Hounds upon this estabilishment because I'd hate to come back and see a line up.  Sometimes this happens when I write things.  So I'm taking a chance here that when I do come back, I'll be able to enjoy my food and savour my experience like I always have.  Sublime.\n","\n","Oh, I remember why I haven't always come when I remembered.  I don't always have enough money to dine here often because when I do, I'm usually paying for the whole groups bill.  \n","Anyone want to join me and share the bill?\n","\n","Typos' written free of charge with each YouTube video I make of my escapades.\n","I am just going to clarify because I still feel people will get mixed up. This is the night market right by River Rock, and not the one by Ikea. If you want to go to the one by Ikea, you can take a free shuttle which leaves right by the bus loop/entrance to the parking lot. The one by Ikea has been around for a while, this one has not.\n","\n","Anyways since I don't go to this casino, I don't know the parking arrangement. There was a woman standing right in front of the western side of the parking lot's casino...signaling people to go into the parking lot. Since she wouldn't let us go elsewhere, me and my sister parked, walked down, and went on our way to experience the 'thrill' of the night market. This is where the weird-ness begun...\n","\n","A man in a suit and wearing a wire, seemingly out of nowhere, comes out of the bush (NOT JOKING) hands my sister his phone, and says \"here, take this.\"\n","\n","**Both of us stand there perplexed looking at each other, then back at the man, before she puts the phone to her ear**\n","\n","She listens to the man on the phone, me standing there right beside her in the midst of people wondering what the fuck is going on...\n","\n","Basically the man on the phone said that we couldn't park where we did. What the fuck...how did he know where we parked?\n","\n","Then   other men appear, again seemingly from nowhere. But then I saw more lurking on the individual levels of the parking lot.\n","\n","She appeases the man on the phone, and says, yes, yes, okay we get it.\n","\n","I get into a argument with the man from the bush, saying that if we couldn't park where we parked (parking lot of River Rock) why is a woman signaling the night-marketers to go and park there. Huh moron? He's like well she doesn't work for us deal. I yell at him, I think he got my point.\n","\n","What I am saying is, \"security\" at the River Rock, consists of men watching individual people on all levels of the parking lot, running to the west side of the lot, signaling to the man on the ground, that or calling him....saying get them, get them, those   women with the long, dark hair...\n","\n","This is security at a highly populated casino in Richmond folks.\n","\n","Also if this was such a issue for River Rock, I bet you they could get the location changed because I am sure that the parking lot used for the night market is their property. But they didn't. If it was such a problem, River Rock could have hired it's own traffic managers, and told people exactly where to go if they were going to the night market or the casino, so the people wouldn't get mixed up, and waste time like we did. This would actually save River Rock money in the end because I doubt they caught all the people who parked at River Rock and went to the night market, instead of heading into their casino. \n","\n","Also do they fail to notice how much business River Rock is generating off of this? Whether or not people actually go gamble, they probably go eat at one of their various restaurants. I am just saying that River Rock should have thought this through instead of having \"security\" personnel running back and forth to alert the man in the bush. A little odd, ain't it?\n","\n","Anyhow back to the night market, if fake, cheap iphone/ipad cases/accessories and mediocre food interest you....go here! Honestly that is all I saw here. I remember a few years back I bought a cute change purse, but the purse/accessory stands seem non-existent...I maybe saw one, and they were greatly overpriced...$ + for a thing made in China that will fall apart in a few weeks? I think not.\n","\n","I suggest parking not right by the night market, but right behind the River Rock parking lot, facing the water...because even though it will take a few minutes to walk, it will save you a lot of time getting out at the end of the night. Traffic is hell here. Or better yet, sky-train, but really the night market by Ikea is better...or the one in Chinatown. \n","\n","Lastly it's a loonie to get into this teenage filled, odd smelling, claustrophobic monstrosity.\n","\n","L A M E.\n","health and hygienic concerns with how they run this shady restaurant that was brought to the attention Richmond coastal health authority. In my decades of eating out at  high end & low end places I have never once had   call the health board. I was so disgusted eating here & had to call the health board & seriously recommend you go elsewhere. \n","\n","Here is my experience on Sunday  July  ,  . \n","\n"," / Brown hair on my small plate before even being served. Very unappetizing but took my napkin and wiped it off and thought it was no big deal. \n","\n"," / Food choices:  Very limited options, fast  food quality, very pricey, and very greasy.

You have to order $  bread with your soup to fill u up. Very small portions  leaves u hungry still: \"large size\"  is a $  bowl. It looked very  small because small is  a one cup size for $ .

This adds up to a $  meal with a pop and u barely ate. \n","\n"," / I ordered a $  Caesar salad on the menu that include some seafood. Upon arrival took   bites and there was another short brown hair in the salad. I was really turned off by the experience. Just lost my appetite altogether.

No apology or acknowledgement whatsoever. \n","\n"," / Substandard service. The waiter forgot about us. Food took   minutes to come out for pre made microwaved soup.    mins for a salad.

Too much competition  at these fish & chips places everywhere quality control and management is not there. Ongoing concerns about using old oil to fry food. \n","\n"," / The carpets upstairs @ this restaurant is utterly dirty, filthy with grease stains and smelled like wet carpet. I was turned off going to the bathroom and according to the chart July   was the last time anyone cleaned today was the July  ! Almost   days of no attention to washroom.

I told them that I called in advance and was told that it was $  a lb, and they said it was only for crabs which were under   lbs. Having had at least   Alaskan King Crab in my life, that was clearly a joke - a real Alaskan King Crab does not come under   lbs. The waiter then showed us what people would get for below   lbs. It was not a King Crab - it is another species of crab which is bigger than the regular crabs. However, since we set out to eat Alaskan King Crab, we agreed to pay the premium price for about   pounds and had the real Alaskan King Crab anyway. This is where we made the mistake - we showed them that we could afford it and they got greedy to gyp us further beyond the $  King Crab. We continued our ordering of soup, vegetables and black cod hotpot. The waiter then suggested that we should have seabass instead of the black cod hotpot, and we can order a  -dish seabass combo. We thought it was also fish, and it was probably good because he recommended it. They came show us the live Alaskan Crab, but did NOT show us the seabass, so we thought maybe the fish was not fresh or whole.\n","\n","We finished eating the soup and king crab - not amazing food and the king crab looks less than   lbs, but okay, and after waiting for   very long mins, we finally saw the two dishes for seabass. Oh my goodness - these two dishes are HUGE - definitely not reasonable for my table. I suddenly noticed that they did cook a whole fish for us, but didn't show us the fish live, so we could not tell whether it was alive or it was HUGE for my table of   (  seniors,   adults and   child). If this is not dishonestly and lack of integrity, I don't know what is. As expected, when I saw the bill, the seabass was   lbs. For those who are not familiar, a  .  lb fish is used for a table of   during banquet, and this restaurant decided (without telling/showing us) that my table of  .  adults (senior and child is about  .  adult) should have   lbs of Alaskan King Crab followed by   lbs of seabass, in addition to the soup and vegetables we were ordering. We must look like very hungry huge eaters since I am only a  -lb myself. Of course, the seabass was not cheap per lb, so in the end, the bill was $ . I packed some of the seabass home in the end to not waste it.\n","\n","It is not that we don't have expensive dinner, but this has been the most unenjoyable and shocking $  dinner that I have had. We were just expecting to have a nicer than average dinner on a weekday and ended up being gyp'ed by these people intentionally. There are way too many good, if not better, Chinese restaurants around - there is no need for me to support a dishonest restaurant as such. The sister restaurant, Empire seafood, also had the same false advertising. I will absolutely not return for dinner on my own accord - I will take my hard-earned money somewhere else and support people who don't set out to cheat their customers.\n","Been hearing a lot about this bbt shop for a while now,  apparently they're pretty big on the east coast. So when I heard they were opening up   locations in Vancouver all at once I thought to myself \"dang they're ambitious, must be selling legit bbt!\" \n","\n","So last week after work I decided to give them a try and the closest one to me at the time was the Broadway location I decided to go there. This being said, I really should've given them a call before hand. Given my track record, I often find myself visiting places when they're closed and lo and behold they were closed. To be more specific, still under construction, lol. \n","Regardless, I was craving me some \"bo ba nai chaaaa\" and made the executive decision to head to the Richmond location; because one way or another I was going to be drinking Chatime that night. \n","\n","I arrived and to my surprise, there wasn't much of a line up which was strange given their BOGO promotion they had. *I do realize I'm writing this post after the promotions over and doesn't really apply, but whatever... Sue me *\n","I decided to get their famous Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly.\n","Even though I asked for half sugar, I found their drinks to be on the sweeter side. Not sure if they made the order wrong being a new place or what, but overall it was good. The roasted flavours within the drink weren't as pronounced as I would've liked but then again just my personal preference. \n","Whereas the grass jelly was one I haven't had anywhere else. It was VERY gelatinous and didn't have much flavour. Though one may argue, grass jelly typically doesn't, I believe you can taste a distinct difference from a fresh made one as opposed to ones you buy in a can. \n","\n","Came back the day after *yes I like my bbt... Don't judge me* and got a speciality drink the Taiwan Mango QQ strictly because of it's name. It was quite disappointing...to say the least. This is a drink you expect to get from a restaurant with an identify crisis, claiming to serve bubble tea. It was a mix of pearls with coconut jelly sitting in what I can only imagine as mango extract and syrup. It felt like I grew cavities as I drank not, haha. \n","\n","I can honestly say I understand why people are ecstatic over their drinks and what the buzz has been about. They serve a variety number of drinks, smoothies, and lattes, but I still have a soft spot for the drinks served at Shiny Tea; I feel the beverages they serve are more simplistic and refined. This way you can truly appreciate the tea flavour. \n","When it comes to bbt, for me anyway, less is always more.\n","\n","(+) Huge selection of drinks! \n","(+) Can choose the sweetness and ice for each drink. \n","(+) Takes credit cards and interac\n","(+) Lots of parking! \n","\n","(-) Was not able to customize my order with a specific drink. =/\n","(-) Some drinks are a hit and miss. \n","(-) Tea flavour in drinks aren't as pronounced *but that can just be me*\n","*Nothing like the original Paesanos*  \n","\n","Cliff notes:\n","- Terrible food\n","- Average service\n","- Not worth the money\n","- Won't be going back\n","\n","After a day in Steveston   rolled around and we decided it was time for dinner.  The restaurant/patio was half full, which should have been a sign considering it was a hot, clear, summer weekend in Steveston!  But we had already made a reservation earlier in the day.\n","\n","Walked in and the place was very nice looking and rather upscale.  The staff, with the exception of a single young waitress, was chaotic and all over the place running around in complete disorganization.  Just trying to get a table for a large party took us nearly   minutes despite our reservation, and it wasn't because they were busy. \n","\n","We were finally seated, and immediately we noticed that everyone in the restaurant had a complimentary blanket, and that it was about   degrees.  They had cranked the A/C to an uncomfortable level (I prefer it cold), and rather than turning it down/off, they were offering blankets.  \n","\n","The first thing I looked at was the wine list.  I noticed that they had advertisements for multiple great wineries, and that branding was everywhere.   Turns out they don't serve those wines, but other less desirable wines with price tags much higher than other comparable restaurants.  \n","\n","We started off with a bunch of appetizers around the table to share.  \n","- Stuffed Mushroom Caps\n","- Shrimp and Scallop Salad\n","- Italian Meatballs\n","- Crab Cakes\n","\n","Almost an hour later our appetizers came out:\n","\n","The Stuffed Mushroom Caps - There was NO stuffing, they were tiny button mushrooms lightly fried in butter.  For a $  appetizer I was expecting more  than   small mushroom caps or at least higher quality. \n","\n","Shrimp and Scallop Salad - This was nothing of the sort.  It was a plate of lettuce with   shrimp and   scallops on the side.  Again, for $ , I expected something more or better\n","\n","Italian Meatballs - There was   of them and they were huge.  so big that in order to cook them all the way through they were cooked to death.  They were dry, crispy and without flavour. \n","\n","Crab Cakes - There was   of them, they were completely black on both sides, completely dried out, and bland bland bland.\n","\n","This was far less food than we were expecting, and we were so hungry at this point that we nearly finished our appetizers before our waitress left the table.  Despite how bad the food was, after waiting nearly   hours we were starving.\n","\n","We ordered our main courses\n","- Lamb Steak with mushroom demiglaze and steamed seasonal vegetables (the special)\n","- Cod Filet in a lemon, dill butter sauce with steamed vegetables (another special)\n","- Calamari\n","- Seafood Fettuccine\n","\n","Another   minutes later the main courses arrived\n","\n","I had the lamb steak, I ordered it medium rare, and I received it nearly raw.  It was incredibly tiny for a \"lamb steak\", it was smaller than most lamb chops.  Not to mention that my first bite was a mouthful of shattered lamb bone.  The mushroom demiglaze was basically uncooked mushrooms with a can of mushroom gravy,somehow with less flavour.  And the steamed seasonal vegetables was a plate of raw vegetables, with the exception of the green beans,  which were surprisingly steamed to perfection. \n","\n","I asked around and it seems that my plate was pretty much on par with the rest of the table. \n","\n","Service:\n","Our server was responsible for one table, so she was attentive, but seemed to be lacking the knowledge and workings of a restaurant.  Much of the wine we ordered ended up on the table as she was pouring our glasses.  She was overly frazzled and in a rush, speeding through everything without the skills to move quickly.\n","Traveling across the boarder to another country to discover the best place ever on the North American Continent to eat Xiao Long Bao (shanghai dumpling)!!!\n","\n","I've been desperately trying to find my dimsum after having it in San Francisco. And finding it in SF is still a challenge. Seattle's never heard of it and no chinese restaurant that serves dimsum serves XLB. I started to yelp trying to find the spot to have Xiao Long Bao and haven't found any hits until some the reviewer before me. CRAB Xiao Long Bao caught my attention and it was a MUST to try. It was our first destination after crossing the Canadian boarder to come to Shanghai River for breakfast. It was half a block away from Richmond Hilton the place we were staying at. How perfect was that!\n","\n","There was only one review for Shanghai River and someone not local so I had no real expectation of this place and thought it was probably a shack restaurant. But when we passed by it the place looked really nice. Parking was available and no line (yet) at  : . The best part was watching the ladies behind the glass wall as you eat make fresh dimsum. \n","\n","Richmond, Canada hold a very high Chinese population. I felt outcasted that we were one of the very few unable to speak Chinese so getting service was a little harder. We were kind of being ignored but as we spoke up for service we were attended to promply afterwards. The menu made my mouth water like no other. And the portions here were no stingy for the price you pay.\n","\n","Our order consist of:\n"," ) one order of Xiao Long Bao (shanghai style Dumpling)\n"," ) one order of Crab Long Bao (shanghai style Dumpling)\n"," ) Braised Eggplant dish\n"," ) one order of Shrimp/Chive Dumpling\n"," ) Side of Rice\n","\n","I LOVE EATING XIAO LONG BAO with rice. There is a distinct way to eating Miniced Pork Xiao Long Bao (  pieces). The dimsum dumpling shell was perfect, fresh, and not stale and hard. The miniced pork inside was amazingly delicious, and the broth inside was so yummy. How to eat Xiao Long Boa, place dimsum on spoon, poke a whole at the end of the dimsum with your chopstick, either pour the broth on your rice or  sip it out of the dimsum, and then dip the Xiao Long Bao in the special dipping sauce they give you. \n","\n","The CRAB Xiao Long Bao (  pieces) was very tasty and good. I wasn't much of a fan because the grab taste is very powerful and I like the regular miniced pork Xiao Long Bao. But it was definately a treat to eat real Crab with miniced pork  xiao long bao. That could never be ordered in San Francisco.\n","\n","The Shrimp/Chive Dumpling was SO good. Definately different then all the times I've ordered it at all other dimsum places in SF and Seattle. Something about this dumpling in Richmond, Canada was just tastier and I cannot put my finger on it.\n","\n","And last but not least, the Braised Eggplant Dish was \"EEHH\" not feeling it. The sauce was too spicying and drenched the Eggplant. I would have liked it more if they lighted up the sauce and put the sauce on the side. I do not think I will ever order this dish again. We ended up packing it after a few bits and giving it away to a homeless guy on Robson Street. I wonder what he thought when he opened the to go box?\n","\n","Our bill was very affordable even after out exchange rate is even. Definately my favorite restaurant in Richmond, Canada. Especially when I want XLB. Other chinese restaurants aren't as fresh as this place, where you actually get to see them make your DimSum from scratch. But I must say after   there is a long line forming at the front.\n","\n","TWO THUMBS UP!!!\n","A few days ago on May  , I called the DQ located at   No.   Road in Richmond BC (Tel:  - - ) in the evening and spoke to team lead Rosanna and explained to her that my son's Dilly Bar fell off the popsicle stick upon removing from the wrapper. I asked her for a replacement and she sounded hesitant but said ok and told me to come in with the receipt. Today I went to see Rosanna with my receipt and she refused to give me a replacement Dilly Bar. When I asked her why, she stated that it's because the Dilly Bars come packaged from DQ head-office so she has to follow-up with them. I then told her that I am going to make a complaint to head-office myself because of the inaction by her (I told her that even though the Dilly Bars come packaged from head-office, her DQ restaurant is responsible for what is given to customers). She said go ahead and make a complaint. Meanwhile, I proceeded to order two  /  ultimate burger meals with fries and drink and asked her for fresh fries. As we were about to eat our burger, Rosanna came over to the table with a free Dilly Bar and told me not to make a complaint to head-office. She went back to the counter to store my Dilly Bar in the fridge. I tried to get her attention to come over to our table again to point out the sub-standard over-fried and bitter-tasting hard fries with fryer burn marks but she got distracted with customers that just walked through the front doors so I called over one of the front counter servers/workers to our table and I told him the burgers taste great but the fries are horrible and I showed him the burn marks on both sets of fries and asked him why I had great fries last time I was there but this time there is a bitter taste and over-fry look (I asked him if the oil was old). He acknowledged the inconsistency and stated the cook may have set the timer a few minutes too long but did not offer to replace both sets of fries for us. I told him it's not fair to us to pay for DQ quality fries and get this type of hard bitter fries. He was really nice and said he would talk to the team lead Rosanna. He went and spoke to Rosanna about it and made her aware of the issue but she did not bother to come over to our table and check and correct the fries for us. Take a look at the attached photo showing how the fries have burn marks. It looked bad and it tasted bad but they don't care about customers getting the proper DQ quality fries. Since they (the team lead and management at DQ #  ) don't care about consistency in providing quality fries that meets the DQ standard then we as customers should not give this type of DQ restaurant our hard earned money. I literally still have a bitter taste from the bad fries we received and I feel like we wasted our money there! My thing is simply don't serve great fries one day and then bad fries the next day and expect the proactive customer to be ok with sub-quality...that's not respecting the customer's intelligence to recognize consistency. A majority of us customers don't bother complaining which makes it hard to hold these types of neglectful restaurants accountable for value.\n","I grew up in Richmond so I'm quite used to impolite waitresses and bad service. But wow, this place really brings it up a notch!\n","\n","We heard that this was the only place in Richmond comparable to HK BBQ Master by Superstore, so we wanted to give it a try. We walked in at  :  and waited around   for a table, which was reasonable considering the amount of attention this place gets. \n","\n","The place was packed, so we were herded to a corner table by the bathroom. We had very late lunches so we only ordered a  -item BBQ rice and a soy chicken soup noodle to share. But we felt bad for taking up a  -person table so we added half of a soy chicken too. Soon the waitress returned and told us the half chicken was sold out. \n","\n","When the BBQ rice came, we stared at the plate, speechless. A single soy chicken wing, chopped into tiny pieces, lay upon the rice. Just the middle section and the tip too, composed of mostly bone. The BBQ duck portion of the combo looked a bit more promising.. But once I flipped it over with my chopsticks, only   of the   pieces had any meat on them. The other   pieces were basically rib cage and skin.\n","\n","We waved the waitress over and asked her if she could exchange the tiny chicken wing for us, and she agreed. Soon she returned and told us they were out of chicken, and asked if we would want BBQ pork instead, we agreed. We didn't want to cause her too much trouble as she already gave us the courtesy, so we didn't bother mentioning how the duck was all bone. \n","\n","My friend's soy chicken soup noodle had a decent portion of meat, but the soup was tasteless.. And after she had made it a quarter way through the bowl, she discovered a fly floating around in her soup. We waved the waitress over and asked her to take it away. Again, the nice lady was very polite and offered to take it off our bill. \n","\n","So the dining experience was pretty bad already.. To top off our night, when the cashier lady (owner?) brought our bill over, she stared at us, commented \"FOUR PEOPLE,   BBQ RICE!\", slammed the bill on our table, and stormed off. \n","\n","Wow. \n","\n","We understand that your restaurant is very busy and we are taking up a  -person table here. But really, did you have to belittle us like that? We did order another half chicken and a noodle, but it was unfortunate that the other dishes could not be delivered... \n","\n","We asked the cashier lady to come by so we could explain how we did order other dishes, but she ignored us. When the nice waitress approached our table, the cashier yelled at her and said \"Don't bother listening to them!\"... The waitress came over anyway and listened to us explain. She understood the whole situation and even told us she knew the BBQ duck was all bones.. and apologized on the owner's behalf. We left tips for her anyway.\n","\n","The food was good. Maybe she was just having a bad day. But we're Never going back again.\n","My family and I have been to Richmond many times, but always went to the same places, so we wanted to try something new. We landed on this spot, and I'm quite happy with the choice! This place makes pretty authentic versions of Shanghai and Jiangsu dishes for a really good price.\n","\n","We were actually quite lucky to get a table, as almost all of the tables were reserved that evening for large families coming out for a Sunday dinner.\n","\n","We ordered a lot for this meal, but most of them were small dishes. For cold dishes, we got smoked fish, jelly pork, and drunken chicken. We also got shengjian bao and xiaolong bao as they were popular here. For the main dishes, we got the classic lion's head and something called huotui jin bai, which was cabbage in a white sauce with some ham.\n","\n","Okay, I can acknowledge that a lot of these dishes don't sound... particularly appetizing. But don't stop reading, please! All of these dishes have something good about them, I swear.\n","\n","Let's start with the shengjian bao. The shengjian bao was a very solid bun. It was fresh off the pans and way too hot to eat at first, so hooray for fresh buns! The outside was extremely crispy, and the inside of the bun was nice and soft. The meat filling was pretty standard, good but nothing to write home about. It was EXTREMELY juicy, with it pouring out once you take a bite. For those who aren't familiar with this bao: LET IT COOL! You'll scorch your mouth if you don't! Don't let a hot bun ruin your day :(\n","\n","Have you been to Din Tai Fung? So you must've had their xiaolong bao, then! Yeaaa don't expect that here. This XLB is REALLY good, but it is in no way shape or form the XLB you would normally expect. Shanghainese XLBs are normally very delicate and small, with a very thin wrapper. This is not that kind of XLB. What you get, instead, is a thicker wrapper, almost like an actual dumpling, a larger sized bao, and a much fattier and heavier meat filling and soup. And that almost sounds like the opposite of a conventional XLB. But here's the thing. It works. Yes, it may be a bit off-putting at first, but the meatiness of the filling and the fattiness of the soup works so well with the vinegar dipping sauce. Please, give this version of XLB a try, it'll definitely open your eyes to how diverse Chinese food can be, even down to regional differences of the same dish!\n","\n","The cold dishes were all good. My favorite was the smoked fish. The smokiness of the fish mixed very well with the sweet sauce, and was quite balanced. There weren't that many bones in addition, so nice plus! The jelly pork took a bit of time for me to warm up to. At first, I thought, \"This is just spam.\", but eventually I started to get the appeal! The drunken chicken wasn't my thing, though. The wine taste was way too strong. On the contrary, though, my dad loved the chicken!\n","\n","Moving on, the lion's head. Oh, don't worry! It's not actually lion's head! It's a meatball. Erm, I mean, three FAT meatballs. They give a lot for this dish. The meatball isn't made of super finely minced meat, it's more chunky than a traditional meatball, and also has some vegetables in it. But does it really hit the spot! It soaks up the incredibly savory sauce like a sponge, and is just Chinese comfort food to the max. My parents loved this dish, and said that it was incredibly authentic to how it's normally made in China, so a big kudos for that!\n","\n","The cabbage was, surprisingly, really delicious! It was just a head of napa cabbage in a sauce, but it really worked. It was almost like a soup, with the broth being the weird, goopy translucent sauce. But I'll have to admit, I would order it again! It's really hard to describe the flavor, but it's just good please get it!\n","\n","This meal was only $  once converted to USD, which is a ridiculously low price for the amount we got.

As soon as you walk near it, the cold hard fact that simplified Chinese is their menu's primary language glares at your face.  As you struggle to read the tiny jumbled \"english\" between the lines, you realize this is authentic as it gets.  And it's true.  Their dialects, their menu and cooking style, is straight from Mainland China, where I spent a few years, and it kinda felt like home to me.  I know there are plenty of authentic chinese restaurants around, but this particular one felt like ones from a street bazaar, or a small shop, in China.\n","\n","The first mistake I made was that you are given a number after you make your order, because they are made to order (fresh! hot!) and you'll have to wait.  I didn't receive that number, instead I had walked away after paying to a nearby unoccupied stool.  After watching a few other customers walk up and paid, then receive a number, I walked over and spoke to them in mandarin, which I've noticed them speaking to the customers.  I think all the time I spent there I saw only chinese customers, like favorites I guess.  I saw a caucasian elderly couple look at the menus curiously, but they didn't order in the end.  After I spoke to them in their native, their demeanor changed instantly, before the older man was ice cold.  The lady had been cranking out the little XLB's non-stop throughout the whole time, but she would answer questions from customers when they speak to her in chinese.  I don't know if she understands canto, but I wouldn't test her, lol.  The cook was a younger kid in his   i think, sporting a styled blondish/copperish hairstyle neatly tucked under a chef's hat, and he was pretty quick and efficient.  Don't underestimate youngsters.  In Mainland China, in those small diners I think they  % hire some kids to help out in the kitchen.  These kids probably learned from their parents at an early age, as they are expected to help out in the household, so their skills can be trusted.  They actually look pretty clean too.  Prices are pretty decent, I didn't have time to try their XLB's or dumplings so I only grabbed the cumin beef sandwich that was pan fried.  Let's just say, as I drove home I couldn't help grabbing a few bites at the red lights!  Dang, they even leave in the trimmings, now that is legit...!\n","\n","Highly recommended if you are from the area, or in the area coming from somewhere.  The people that work at this mall must gain a bit of weight, they are so lucky to have such a fantastic food court.  R & H, Taco Luis, Let's Roll, a Pho place, and the usuals like Subway, A & W, KFC, I'd go out of my way home from work on a few \"detours\" to this mall just for the food.\n","I have been to this restaurant with my friends for over three years now on numerous occasions. I even had one of my birthday parties here but today I regret to say that I will never come back. Today I came to Toyotomi during this rainy summer day in hopes to have hot pot. Upon arriving we were not acknowledged and it took   minutes to get us a table despite having open tables with cutlery ready to go. Starving and cold, when we finally got to sit down and order, it wasn't until   minutes that we received our hot pot. It took ten additional minutes for them to bring out this twisted soggy room temperature meat dish. It was in such disgusting shape, my bowels are still cringing for consuming a single piece of this disaster dish. I also ordered a pork dumpling where no pork was found. I even asked the waiter to find me the pork in the dumpling and she could not. This was a sample size of   dumplings in which none had pork. Talk about misleading and deceptive marketing practices. Starving and upset because less than half the food we ordered was of basic edible quality, we decided to ask for a manager. The manager came out and was very rude and confrontational. He only had the intention of proving the customer wrong. He said he took out the meat into the cooler and that this was a common practice. Given the meat was in room temperature and not only this meat . He had brought in another sample and it was the same. it was obvious that he was lying and running a business that could potentially get many other customers sick. We have come to this restaurant before and never has this dish been served on an old creaky cutting board with room temperature meat that became rock hard after cooking. We told him that it was not fair that we had to pay full price for low and dangerous food. He said that he could only send back the beef to the kitchen. He said that the dumplings were made by the supplier and that it has nothing to do with his operations and the same with the meat. However restaurants do have the fiduciary duty to inspect products and ensure that they are of edible quality. The manager argued with us for an hour and yelled at us telling us to \"take food classes\". We told them that we would be posting a review showing users the quality of food. He told me to ask around customers if the dumpling had pork and everyone said no. Seeing that we were gaining traction and attention from other customers, in desperation he gave us a half assed apology stating that we would still have to pay  % of the meal. At this point we were starving and tired and we just wanted to leave the restaurant so we paid the  % and left. I would never recommend coming back to this restaurant. The service is slow, the quality has gone downhill and I definitely hope that Foodsafe checks into their operations because the room temperature raw meat has a huge potential of causing food poisoning and is dangerous to anyone who decides to eat here. TLDR? \n","\n","Don't waste your money here, eat elsewhere. The manager is rude and self righteous.\n","Coming for a hot pot experience that is not AYCE, one would have to think about coming to this place. Part of the Top Gun group of restaurants, right along Garden City, in Richmond, this fairly sized restaurant on the main level of this plaza (on McKim and Garden City) houses a pretty good hot pot experience. With the overflood of this style of cuisine, there are tons to choose from in regards to cooking your own food, and I would put this one high due to service and quality.\n","\n","My review is purely based on having dinner, and not the lunch and dim sum that they also serve. If your used to eating AYCE hot pot, it is going to take a little to stomach the price per dish of the stuff you would usually not even care about (because it is AYCE) and just order due to the instinct of your stomach of just being hungry, so it is something to get used to when you cannot just randomly order everything on the menu, and you have to pick and choose. You may wonder on how much your getting with each selection priced at certain price points and calculate how much that usual $  per head charged to you is worth prior to ordering. Just realize this, how many of us can actually eat their own money's worth when doing the 'all you can gorge' menu, and when is it enough.\n","\n","Two people, we ordered a plate of sirlion beef, a plate of lamb, tofu, udon, enoki mushrooms, and cabbage, with a satay soup base. We were struggling at the end to finish all we ordered. They also come around always refilling your plum juice, a nice concentration, not too sweet, with a little zing. The orders for each individual plate of raw food is a fare size, when you start dabbling into dipping/cooking the food in the broth of your choice. Sometimes due to the instinct of the stomach, we tend to believe things look small, and our stomach is the big bad monster ready to devour a city, but that just is not the case, and the food I ordered between the two of us was just right, if not more than enough. The other thing, ordering by/being charged by the dish is the quality control. This place has been here for many years, and the care on the quality of each dish that is coming out is good, for raw food. The meat is just right, not too frozen, the vegetables are all washed clean, the tofu is arranged nicely on a plate, small little garnishing aside, this place is solid.\n","\n","Remember, since this is one of those Top Gun restaurants, if you paid for their membership card, you get an additional  % off. In price, this would have worked out to be the same, but you would not get into the moral delemna of over ordering, and fearing what the people say about you, due to the fact you are actually paying per plate!\n","Dragon View Chinese Cuisine is located on the second floor of Continental Shopping Centre in Richmond and has a pleasant looking interior with interesting chandeliers that, to me, resembled the round leaves of a money tree (lunaria annua). There's also a large floral mural on one wall made up of tiny metallic and glass tiles.\n","\n","Knowing that dim sum restaurants fill up quickly on the weekends, we arrived shortly after they opened and managed to get seated right away. The food, however, took quite a while to come out (probably about   minutes).\n","\n","Our first dish, the Steamed Country Style Rice Rolls with Chicken Feet and Spareribs ($ . ) had layers of clear, wavy rice rolls. I was actually expecting more than one chicken feet in this dish and I think they forgot to give us soy sauce initially. Once it was appropriately \"sauced up\", I was actually quite pleased with the texture of these rice rolls.\n","\n","Next up was the Siu Mai ($ . ) which were topped with a plump shrimp and tobiko. I've never seen it served this way before and thought it was quite novel but didn't necessarily add to how it tasted.\n","\n","These football-shaped dumplings are Haam Sui Gok ($ . ), a type of deep-fried dumpling with a meat filling encased in a crispy outer layer with a pleasant chewy texture from the glutinous rice dough.\n","\n","The Chef's Special Shredded Chicken ($ . ) or sow see gai is a popular cold dish and is known for the crunchiness of the ingredients which contrasts with the tender and savory chicken.\n","\n","The Steamed Beef Balls ($ . ) are one of our go-to dishes at dim sum and are usually served on top of tofu skin with a Worcestershire dipping sauce.\n","\n","Last up for us was the Chinese Donut Rice Roll ($ . ). Inside the velvet-textured rice roll was a crispy Chinese donut as well as pork floss.\n","\n","Despite the long wait for our food, we did quite enjoy the food here so we wound up coming back for a revisit   weeks later. Having ordered the Chinese donut rice roll previously, we wanted to try something different and picked the Steamed Beef Rice Roll ($ . ) which turned out pretty good. The food also turned out to come out quicker on our second visit.\n","\n","Similarly, the Har Gow ($ . ) was a solid dish with large and plump shrimp inside the moderately thick wrapper.\n","\n","The Deep Fried Squid ($ . ) had a nice golden hue from the batter and was coated with a mixture of diced garlic and hot peppers. A couple of pieces were a bit too chewy but the rest turned out pretty good.\n","\n","I found that the Steamed Spareribs with Garlic ($ . ) was one of their weaker dishes as there were quite a bit of fatty and inedible pieces in the dish.\n","\n","While the dishes were a bit on the pricier side, most of the food items were pretty good and I wouldn't hesitate to come back (just make sure to go early before it gets busy).\n","DON'T GO HERE! $ /person for stuff from Costco and Pricesmart grocery stores? I've paid the same price at other high tea places and their food was ALL hand-made or baked in-house. But Avery cheaps out with serving some items that you can buy from the grocery store. I recognized some of the food that my mom buys for our family, LOL. If you read the famous food blogger \"Eating with Kirby\", her blog tells you not to go to Avery Cakes because she says they serve grocery store food. She's actually right!\n","\n","I went here with a few friends for high tea last week. We thought the place was so awesome and pretty until we tasted the food. The only good thing about this place is how pretty it is, that's it. Come at least once if you want to look at a pretty place, but don't order the high tea. Not worth it. \n","\n","Chicken noodle soup - canned Campbell soup. I recognize the taste and the canned tasting pasta right away. You can get at Pricesmart or Safeway. They took out the fake chicken bits hoping you won't recognize this is a canned soup. \n","\n","Skewers: This was totally the Costco Yakitori skewers. I recognize the exact taste, seared grill lines, the stick, and sauce, b/c our family always buys these. Holy crap, am I paying $  high tea for Costco food? ** I posted a photo of it and Yelp removed my photo, probably because Avery reported me, lol. **\n","\n","Staff: bad English. Come on, we're in Canada. I know you cater to an all Chinese clientele but at least have people who can understand English well. And staff is so slow to serve, what are they doing? It takes so long to get water to refill the teapot.\n","\n","Teapot: only   teapot is included per two high tea sets, so   people have to share   tea pot flavor. So if you like chocolate tea, but your friend likes green tea, then there is going to be a problem.   of you can't get your favorite tea. At other high tea places, they include   teapot PER person so my friend gets her own tea and I get my own tea. Why is Avery making this so cheap? They used to even NOT include teapots in their old high tea menus if you read old reviews.\n","\n","Sandwiches: processed cheese... ewww. really?? use real cheese, these sandwiches were so thin on meat and stuff. it was mostly bread, processed cheese, and very little meat and stuff inside it. I have never had such an empty high tea sandwich before.\n","\n","The desserts seemed like they were made in-house and were the only redeeming part of the high tea. So I did like the desserts but that's it. Everything else was blah. Honestly, this was worth $ , not $ .\n","\n","Hey, if you are the owner of Avery Cakes, go try high tea at your competitors and you will see the difference. All their stuff is mostly hand-made and I cannot recognize them as grocery store food because they seem to make their own stuff: Fairmont Notch  , Wedgewood Bacchus Lounge, Patisserie Fur Elise, L'Opera Patisserie, La Petite Culliere, Neverland Tea Salon, The Secret Tea Garden, The Urban Tea Merchant. I do a lot of high tea so I know when a high tea is good and when a high tea is bad. Don't say I'm picky or choosy like you did on EatingwithKirby's instagram. I'm just being  % honest. And don't say I'm a friend of your competitor. I have been going to high tea everywhere for over   years. The only high tea place that is worse than Avery is \"Tea Impressions\" in Richmond which I gave   star for that one. I'm giving Avery   stars just for how nice the place looks and how pretty the food is. But financially, food and price not worth it. Apparently, food bloggers have been spreading around in Vancouver that the owner yells at you on Instagram if you write a bad review. I don't have Instagram so I don't have to worry about being yelled at for writing this review.\n","To be fair, I always try to keep an open mind. I had a mixed bag of experiences with this place. While my experience the first time I came was okay, it was my second interaction with this place that made me swear off Nu completely.\n","\n","The first time I came here, it was because a family friend insisted that Nu's food was much better than other Shanghainese places like Shanghai Wonderful/Shanghai River/Chen's. I personally found the food to be pretty average as far as Shanghainese fare is concerned - if anything, I almost feel like the upscale atmosphere helps mask the fact that Nu's food is nothing to write home about. \n","\n","You do have to give them props for their XLB, the broth is light-bodied and doesn't beat you over the head with MSG. Smoked duck however was as dry as the Sahara - twice-fried and not juicy like smoked duck should be. I also picked up on the unfriendly service other reviewers mentioned, but it wasn't so bad (probably because my dad recognized our server from Shanghai Wonderful where she worked before, so she seemed a bit friendlier). The rest of the servers on the other hand, did kind of give off that \"ugh, why am I here\" aura which made me a bit leery. Our bill also took a millennia to get back - it was like they didn't want to turn over the table and get more customers!\n","\n","The second time with this restaurant, my dad wanted to eat here for lunch on a Thursday with the entire family (mind you, we wanted to have lunch at  :  and figured reservations are in order). \n","\n","This is where it gets just absolutely ridiculous. I called in to make reservations for four people, only to be surprised when the lady on the phone said that (and I kid you not) I couldn't make reservations for my party of four. She had mentioned that I could only make reservations if I had   or more people in my party. To me, that is just absolutely ridiculous. I asked her if the same rule applied during dinner (she said yes) and was just shocked that a restaurant would have such an odd and quite frankly silly policy in place. I'm fairly certain no other restaurant in Richmond has a similar policy in place (even popular places like Fisherman's Terrace which often has lines out the door during lunch). \n","\n","Like I get that as the new restaurant on the block, it's hard to keep up with the demand of people wanting to try the place out. I get that this is probably their way of enforcing what is effectively crowd control. But it's just such a bizarre policy which really just helps turn away people who want to give this place a chance. What if I had wanted to come on a date? What if I was some old couple that just wanted to have lunch at a nicer establishment? A  -person family? Am I forced to eat during off-peak hours so I'm not made to wait an eon for a table?\n","\n","Two stars, because of the average food, uncomfortable service, and bizarre reservation policy. The place's only saving grace is it's decor, which is quite classy and a nice change of pace in Richmond.\n","If you're looking for a place that'll get you full and serves individual hot pots at a reasonable price, then Gokudo Shabu Shabu is the place for you!\n","\n","I went for the first time with my special homie about two weeks ago (before the COVID-  issue started closing down restaurants everywhere) and I had a great time there. It was memorable, satisfying, and having the ability to control the heat on your own individual hot pot at the table added a fun element. The wait time was about   minutes since the two of us came at peak dinner time around  : , but the wait was totally worth it.\n","\n","For the inexperienced, this is a place where food is served to you raw from the kitchen, and then you do the cooking at your table! It's a very straightforward process. Once you sit down, you work your way from left to right on the menu, deciding what kind of meal you want. Within about   minutes after informing your server of your choices, you'll be ready to eat! Service is efficient and to-the-point, with my server helping me out with the menu since it was a bit confusing to read at first, but the servers were all polite and friendly!\n","\n","Reasons why Gokudo is getting a  -star review from me:\n","\n"," ) Quality food, quantity of food, and food selection\n","There is a large menu with a plethora of items to choose from including all kinds of meats, vegetables, soup bases, and additional toppings. You can literally customize everything about your meal from what drink you want to the amount and kinds of meats and veggies you want. \n","\n","No matter what you choose, everything comes out seeming fresh and ready to be cooked! I ordered the laksa soup which was perfectly spicy and flavourful while my special homie ordered the vegetarian soup base that was full of mushrooms and other goodness. No complaints about any of the food at any time of our experience. If anything, there was too much food! I opted for the chicken and shrimp main while my fellow diner went with the vegetarian main which was quite filling.\n","\n"," ) Price\n","The final bill came to about $ /person from what I remember, including tips. A full meal combo includes a soup base, a main choice (meat or veggie) which can be mixed and matched to an extent, a platter of additional veggies and meats, and a drink on the side. Remember, it's good food here, and you get what you pay for.\n","\n","I'm a relatively average guy with a big appetite sometimes -  ' \", ~  lbs, kinda athletic - and I was FULL from this meal after eating everything. Full as in absolutely stuffed, but I didn't feel like a grease ball afterwards.\n","\n","Side note: they play a lot of K-pop and Chinese music here so if you're not into that stuff then it might bother you, but trust me the atmosphere is great and I enjoyed it a lot!\n","\n","Whether you're a lone diner, looking to get a decent meal without being disturbed by anyone, or you're coming in with a few friends to celebrate a special occasion, Gokudo is the place to be. I'll definitely come back when this place reopens to satisfy my hot pot cravings. Hopefully soon!\n","Practically skipping the normal times of dinner we decided to go for the da lang () which I have not done in years. On the journey for any kind of good eats at night someone suggested we check out the old HKYK across the street, and because that place was closing at about   and us men can talk like women when gathered together we walked into this place. At the time we came in, about  :  PM it had a few big tables, but nothing close to packed. I think we were out in the cold too long, as this place felt cold, and the a/c felt jacked. Another piece of info you should know is.. if you are some human vampire that needs to hide from light, this place is definitely not for you, as it is beyond bright in here for a late night establishment, like an inside joke of what you bring with you from the clubs this one would give you some insight (or more sight to what you see with who you bring) and also a good view of the food you ordered! This place is open right up to  , another plus for serving the da lang menu, so with the four of us needing dinner the order was put in.\n","\n","Over $  and you get a free large bowl of plain congee (looked like a medium size) so that's a bonus for plain ass white rice porridge. We were shot down on two orders, the deep fried silver fish, and the deep fried chicken knuckle... two of the most popular dishes for late night eats that is like pearls for bubble tea!!!! No matter, we still ended up ordering the peppery deep fried tofu, meat bits with string beans, shrimp with scrambled eggs, some house pork chop (due to not having the two items we actually wanted) and garlic pea snow pea tip, and for a good HK twist to mix with our congee a plate of the soy sauce fried noodle (this is a Chinese thing that I still don't really understand!). The food came kind of out of order, as usual you need the staple congee to come out first like rice on the side, instead we ended up with the scrambled eggs and tofu to start, and this place started getting busier, with two servers, and who knows how many people working in the kitchen, where there were empty tables... there was no more!\n","\n","Each dish that came out was fresh off the fire, hot, steam flying into the air, but this is a restaurant, big flippin deal... how did it taste you ask.. everyone on the table kept picking at the foods like buzzards on a tree top swooping to kill. Each plate excelled in what you would call food that is late night eats.. and the normal impression you get is that as long as it is good enough... well this was the next step, this was freaking good food that I would order anytime of the day. Stuff like the deep fried tofu, looked a little browner, and the bits were far smaller in size than any place I have ever seen, but each cubic bit was perfect, and non-oily. The scrambled eggs were mixed with huge shrimp, and it was semi-runny (perfect), the snow pea tips... again, not oily... like some restaurants I've had this plate for regular dinner. Service was a little slow on this night, but it didn't deter us to order more, even their signature pork chop had a taste that was fit for fried fish, but worked with the pork, this was quality late night food, and we were eating it! \n","\n","Some meals late at night make you feel disgusting when you wake up the next day, this one did not. I did not suffer any mild headache, the food was clean, and that saying I really don't think they are using any MSG... or very little, which is hard to come by. My friend could recognize one of the tables sitting were the dealers from River Rock, I ended up bumping into another friend who was with his staff from one of the bigger restaurants in Richmond, and other tables were just here having a good time with food and booze (saw wine and beer!). The big tv in the back was streaming HK television direct from the source. I have a feeling they were short on staff this night, but that doesn't deter me from giving this place high marks, as I said to others, this was one of the best 'da lang's' I have had in years!! Coming back.. when I'm in for late night eats! Too bad my phone died or I would have some pictures of the eats on this day.\n","I got takeout from   Stones around a week ago, and I was a bit nervous due to the mixed reviews about this place. The portions were pretty decent for most items, with the sets generally being a better value. However, the flavours were quite strong, and made me feel a little sluggish afterwards.\n","\n","Spring Rolls ( / )\n","This was frankly a little disappointing. While the flavour was okay, it had practically no filling and was kind of mushy and doughy on the inside. It was also a very small portion for the price, as the spring rolls were the size of my finger. However, the miso sauce was pretty good, and managed to salvage the spring rolls.\n","\n","Deep Fried Radish Cakes ( / )\n","This was the best thing that I ordered. It came with six radish cakes and they were massive, and this was definitely good value for the price. These also came with miso sauce, but this batch was saltier than the one for the spring rolls. The miso sauce also wasn't mixed properly, and I saw that there was still some unmixed soy sauce or something of that sort inside. These were extremely oily, but that was to be expected. The outside was super crisp and had the perfect amount of batter, while the shredded radish on the inside was nice and not doughy. I really enjoyed this, and would totally get this again.\n","\n","Vegetable Soup ( / )\n","The flavour of this soup wasn't the best and everyone only had one sip before giving up on it, which was a shame since I hate wasting food.\n","\n","Herbal Soup ( / )\n","I didn't try this, but my mom had it and finished it and she said that it was alright.\n","\n","Side Dishes ( . / )\n","The side dishes were mustard greens, two pieces of tofu and one small piece of soy sauce braised gluten. The tofu was like taiwanese soy sauce braised tofu and was pretty good, while the gluten which was nice and spongy. \n","\n","Sesame Noodles ( / )\n","This was disappointing, as the noodles were very mushy and they all clumped together in one big block and were impossible to pull apart. The sesame sauce was also a little grainy and the flavour wasn't very good. It's a shame, since I love sesame noodles.\n","\n","Kung Pao Bean Curd ( / )\n","My parents really enjoyed this dish, and while I thought it was decent, the sauce was too sweet and the dish was lacking the walnuts that I saw in photos. The bean curd was soggy and not crispy, which was fine, but I would have liked them to be crispy just to add an extra textural element to the dish.\n","\n","Sweet and Sour Pork ( / )\n","This was basically the same sauce as the kung pao except it was less intensely sweet, and so I liked this sauce better. The 'pork' was spongy and it was decent but I personally preferred the texture of the bean curd.\n","\n","Eggplant and Basil in Cha Hau Sauce ( / )\n","My grandma didn't like this dish as she said that there was too much vinegar. I personally didn't agree, and I thought it was okay, though it was slightly too salty. The sauce was not what I expected, since I thought it would be sweet and spicy but it was just salty. I liked how the addition of edamame and fake pork mince gave the dish some protein, and the eggplant was tender and cooked well. \n","\n","Overall, most of these dishes aren't bad, but they are heavy on the seasoning, so if you're looking for a light meal this isn't it. I think the only thing I would reorder would be the radish cakes, but they have a pretty extensive menu so I would try other items next time.\n","Disclaimer: My review is mainly focused on the after hour dim sum. The only reason I step into this place is because it's   and my wife is having a dim sum craving. I don't know of any other place with a wide selection and available after  . I'm secretly hoping a fellow yelp'er will help a sister out.\n","\n","I really wish they would take a scrub brush to this place. Not only is it in serious need of a renovation makeover but they really need to fold down the extension flaps on the smaller tables and clean the cracks of food from time to time. That or use some table cloths. Normally, when I sit at the table I like to rest my forearms on the edge - at this place I keep my arms in my lap. Also, at random intervals they'll blast the place with air conditioning. I understand the need to keep the place cooler and ventilated with all of the hot pots steaming, but other places usually just keep it cool at all times instead of taking their customers on temperature roller coaster.\n","\n","The dim sum menu is decent but even though I'm usually pretty good at figuring out which ones are my favourites some of their English descriptions leave me scratching my head and I have to ask the waiter. Because it's after-hour dim sum, understandably, it usually takes   minutes for them to steam the food and then it just comes en masse. \n","\n","When we were there last week, however, for some reason they staggered the food. We were literally eating one dish at a time which made for a less enjoyable experience since the point of dim sum is to have some variety of choices as you eat. The food quality and price is decent enough but nothing that's really amazing so I take what I can get considering the time of day. I can't speak to the hot pot menu because it's been quite a while since I've had it here or other places.\n","\n","I can say that the service is shoddy if you're not having hot pot. The restaurant is pretty big and they like to seat people by the windows which also happens to be at the very opposite end of where the cashier counter is. This makes it impossible to flag down any of the staff who like to hang around the counter until they're needed. The waiters don't think to scan the tables (either physically or with their eyes) to see if the customers need anything.\n","\n","It's worth noting that they accept debit here. Most places only either take credit and/or cash. Also, for their parking lot, even though they have signs every where saying that it's a pay parking lot, we've never once paid and never been fined for it -- not really sure what that's about.\n","\n","  star for having dim sum available all day and night,   star for not robbing me blind for making dim sum available at all hours of the day. -  stars for the cleanliness and service.\n","So tonight we went to one of the new Murder Mystery events at the Steveston Seafood House.  I haven't had dinner there in a while and they were fully booked on my birthday last week so we arranged to go tonight as a party of   (sadly the bf has labyrinthitis so he was stuck in bed and it ended up just being   of us) just to see what it was like and do something different.  The restaurant is naturally sectioned off into   sections so one side was set up for the murder mystery event and the other side was left as the normal restaurant setup.  The menu was set with two choices for each course, drinks were fair game.  We all tried the prosciutto wrapped prawns with a maple syrop glaze (except my parents who had the prawns sans prosciutto due to being semi-vegetarian) which was delicious.  The prosciutto had a taste and texture similar to bacon and you can't go wrong with that.  The duck breast and spinach salad was light and flavourful, the cranberries were a nice touch.\n","\n","The rack of lamb although we all asked for medium rare came as medium to medium well but it was still very juice, had good flavour, and the sides were delicious - lightly roasted vegetables and a sweet potato or yam mash (almost as good as I make myself but I do mine with a touch of spices and rosemary to enhance the flavour).  The dessert we chose was chocolate mousse which was rich but still very fluffy so it wasn't too heavy or too light.  The only downside was the 'garnish' and I seem to remember this being an issue before, but not that big of a deal in my opinion.  The garnish consisted of curled strips of beet with kale leaves, and the leaves were often a little limp and the beet was dry as if it was cut this morning and left in a bowl all day so it was rather hard.  I love beets so it was a tad disappointing especially as the garnish was on every dish but the desserts, but all in all the meal itself was amazing.\n","\n","The murder mystery was fun as well - I won a bottle of spanish wine, which i haven't had in years as we tend mostly to drink australian, german or okanagan wines at the moment.  The setup was an opening list of clues, a vignette with the actors, then question time where they go table to table and you can ask them prying questions - only one actor made it to our table but we managed to get enough to figure out the situation.  We also found a photo under our table mats that we had 'autographed' by another character...they did vignettes between each course, sometimes coming around to talk to guests, my dad even ended up assigned at the very beginning as a 'groupie' for the actress character which was very funny.\n","\n","I will seriously do this again, they are doing more in June, and I have every intention of being there, this time with the sick bf.  They do different mysteries each time, and I would love to see what he thinks because he usually knows who did it within the first two minutes (Literally I got home, mentioned the three types of characters, and had not even gotten into how the thing was set up when he already said who did it - seriously he's talented...playing Clue sucks with him sometimes...he should be in crime investigation or something)...I will be hopefully able to book one of the events in June and I strongly recommend anyone who enjoys Clue or murder mysteries (they often base them on Agatha Cristie type scenarios or 'British' style mysteries) should give it a try!  The food is worth the trip if nothing else!  Their regular menu is delicious as well, the mystery setup just adds an element of fun...and the potential to win a bottle of wine! ;)\n","I may be born and raised in the United States, but I consider myself just as Shanghainese as anyone who actually hails from the city. Both of my parents were born and raised there (and they are both excellent cooks, so I am lucky to have grown up with amazing authentic Shanghai cuisine), and I stay there at least   months a year -- so I know a thing or two about good Shanghai food (restaurant and street food).\n","\n","That being said, Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant is pretty much the bomb. The first time I went (December  ), I was very skeptical (as I tend to be of all restaurants who allege themselves to be authentic Shanghainese food), but I was blown away by their green onion crepes (standard street fare - deliciously greasy) and xiao long bao (the wrapper was thin but did not break easily, the meat was juicy and savory, and the soup inside was heavenly). I ended up going to Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant at least   times (with my parents) during my week long vacation to Vancouver. I went there again a few times during this past spring break (without my parents - March  ), and the food is as excellent as ever. I definitely recommend the sauteed string beans, the nian gao, the Shanghai chao mian, the hong shao rou, the sheng jian bao, and and and... well, I suggest you Yelp-ers go there right now and find a favorite dish for yourselves. =)\n","\n","Service: So I noticed other reviewers were not too impressed with the service, but I had a pretty different experience (this is March  ). Since cannot read Chinese, nor am I proficient in Mandarin Chinese, but I am fluent in Shanghainese and knew what dishes I wanted. I asked my first waitress if she spoke Shanghainese; she didn't but immediately got me someone who did, and he (I think his name was Jimmy? don't quote me on it, though) was able to get me everything I wanted. The next few times I went, I had a waitress (I think her name is Shirley?) who was even more attentive and kind and also made some wonderful recommendations when I asked for a dessert the restaurant did not make (red bean soup). I did have to wait for refills on my tea (in other Chinese restaurants, once you flip the lid, the tea is immediately refilled), but the food was brought to my table very promptly.\n","\n","Ambiance: I agree with Emily, the tables are very close together, and practically every last inch is used. Every time I've gone ( , noon,  ,  ,  ), the restaurant is at  % capacity, with people waiting to be seated. Reservations are DEFINITELY recommended, and if you are only a party of  , you may have to share a table with other  -fers (happened to me once).\n","\n","Price: A little steep for certain dishes (seafood, etc.), but if you're into snacks (dim sum) like me, it is decent, even in this economy (the xiao long bao were less than $ !). The portions are family size, so I recommend going with a group of  + so you can sample a variety of dishes.\n","\n","Overall:\n","Food -  !\n","Service -  . \n","Price -  . \n","Ambiance -   (I enjoy the hustle 'n bustle, but not tripping over wandering babies ^_^)\n","Things didn't appear to be different even after many years of not coming here.  The sign, the decor, the wait, even the prices practically ensured nothing had changed.  But this of course is just a facade as a recent visit confirmed what I had been hearing as of late - this place is disgustingly filthy.\n","\n","Most if not all of my previous experiences were in the Japanese style private booths, where the only way to get in and out is to step or crawl into the seating area.  This meant the bottom of our shoes collectively scuffed the seats and over years of shoe scuffage makes the booth a cesspool of nastiness.  If it's hard for customers to get in and out, it only means it's even harder for the staff to get in to clean it.   \n","\n","Our table looked as if it was clean, shiny and practically embossed, it came as a surprise to my guests when the table was unbearably sticky.  Bubble gum had nothing on the surface of this table, it was just one giant adhesive, presumably from the accumulation of grime and grease.  There was no worry of items shifting around, this table provided the grip for everything from cups to napkins to plates.  At one point I had draped the entire end of the table with napkins to keep my forearms from touching.\n","\n","The menu looks to have the same prices from the last   years.  It also seems to have the same stains as well.  The lamination was breaking down and it seems the food had somehow snuck it's way into the plastic, almost like a makeshift scratch-n-sniff menu.\n","\n","My cup had a little bit of food as well,  dried out pieces of rice stuck to the side made for an interesting texture.  After switching out several stained seating mats, I realized there were food crumbs, dust, and dead bugs all collected along the rims of the wall and seats.  It's one thing to see it at a restaurant, it's also another to actually sit in it.\n","\n","The food was nothing more than a mediocre Japanese food extravaganza.  The sushi was remarkably smooth, but disturbingly warm.  Gyoza was almost gummy, all stuck together like it stayed in a pan for too long.  The surf clams were just a seacup of baked mayo with some sour seafood bits within.  Though the fish jaw was the crowd favorite, it was merely the standout of a lackluster spread.  It all felt frozen or precooked, with no hint of freshness or anything unique, the only thing missing was the crew from Kitchen Nightmares and Gordon Ramsey.\n","\n","Years of popularity for some establishments sometimes translates to years of neglect.  Some places are willing to cut corners to continue the high profits without maintaining the growth.  The added pressure of a half hearted cleaning job and quick food preparation, while rushing customers out, is only sure to create more bad experiences along the way.  And while I hope for the best, it's only a matter of time before Sui Sha Ya crashes and burns.\n","First time going to this restaurant and I felt compelled to write my first EVER review. I didn't read any reviews before going and had no idea what kind of food would be served. Once I read the menu, I realized that this restaurant is not suitable for families with children who can't eat spicy food. Almost  % of the food are heavily spiced, and the noodles in soup that are not spicy are in lamb broth which most kids won't like. We ended up ordering white rice, yam chips and codfish in black bean sauce with special instruction not to make it spicy at all.\n","\n","The skewers are relatively pricey and you have to order at least   per item. So we ordered the lamb special and the beef. When the skewers came, they were covered in spices and you cannot tell apart the taste of beef or lamb since they had so much spices on them. The meats are of low quality, very chewy and dry. IMO they are the worst skewers. The only way to tell the beef and lamb apart is that the lamb skewers were even harder to chew due to the hard fibers in them. After trying these skewers, I feel that the pricing was very unreasonable for such low quality meat and taste.\n","\n","When the codfish came on a hot plate with massive amount of black bean covering the whole fish, I noticed the little amounts of luncheon meat, quail eggs, and noodles we ordered extra, each item was charged quite a lot for such cheap food and little quantities. We were told to wait till the dish boiled before eating, however, upon boiling, the sauce became extremely salty because of the black bean and the noodles became unedible since it had absorbed the sauce.\n","\n","We ordered a jug of fresh squeezed orange juice to go with all these meat. But when I tasted it, it was  % juice, and  % water plus sugar. It tasted nothing like fresh squeezed orange juice! So I asked the waitress about it and I saw a woman not wearing uniform and I assumed she was the \"boss lady\". They charged $  for a small jug. Boss lady explained to me that their machine cannot squeeze enough juice out of the oranges and they are only charging $ , so they can't be  % real juice. Maybe it's just me, I have been to many restaurants, wherever I went and ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, I had received one. I felt cheated when they said it's freshly squeezed, but it tasted worse and less \"orangey\" than the orange juice you get from supermarkets. So at the end, we returned that orange juice and stuck with water. \n","\n","If I were to have one nice thing to say about this place is the waitress was still smiling and providing service after my complaint about the orange juice. One thing I know for sure is I will NEVER come back to this place again! Food quality is low and pricey.\n","With so many dim sum options and limited time, we went with the safe choice for our final Vancouver meal: Kirin. Despite some odd quirks with the service, this was a great place overall for a dim sum brunch.\n","\n","Parking in Vancouver was such a hassle that Kirin's parking garage was a big point in its favor. You have to buy a ticket at the machine (there's one right outside Kirin's entrance), which costs $  CDN, and then present your ticket to a server inside the restaurant, who will take the ticket (you don't need to show it when leaving the garage) and hand you $  in cash. It would be better if it simply came off the bill, but... that's how they do it.\n","\n","We were there on a Monday around   am and decided to try our luck without reservations, since there are several other well-rated dim sum places within a block or so. The hostess made a face when we said we didn't have reservations, and studied her list for a loooong minute before reluctantly saying she could seat us and taking us into a half-empty dining room. It stayed half-empty the whole time we were there and was just beginning to fill up when we left right before noon, so I'm not sure what the big deal was.\n","\n","This is a menu place, not a cart place, although I did occasionally see servers passing through the restaurant offering a tray of some special item. It didn't seem like there was one specific server for our table -- a man greeted us and came back to take our order, but other people brought out our food, and we couldn't find the first guy later when we were trying to get someone's attention to ask for the bill, so it took a long time of sitting and being ignored before we flagged someone else down. On the other hand, the busers were RIGHT on top of hot water refills for tea, clearing plates, etc., so that part of the service was awesome. But the uneven service was weird and frustrating when we just wanted to pay and get out of there.\n","\n","The menu wasn't the biggest I've seen, but most of the usual dishes are on there. The prices are higher, but the portions are also bigger -- so the sticky rice wrapped in leaves was $  CDN vs. $  USD at our usual place, but you also got three pieces vs. one. We got sticky rice (  pieces), spare ribs, chicken feet, fried shrimp spring rolls (  rolls, cut in half), and steamed BBQ pork buns (  pieces). The spring rolls were kind of doughy and un-special, but everything else was well prepared and quite tasty, especially the steamed pork buns. The food came out quickly and nothing was forgotten or incorrect. \n","\n","Everything was good, although I wasn't particularly blown away by anything we had -- it all seemed like pretty standard preparations and sauces. We didn't order dessert because of the server problem, so maybe that was a lost opportunity? \n","\n","Overall, a solid place for dim sum with nicer-than-average ambience and decor, but the somewhat unfriendly service doesn't make me want to rush back.\n","Came here over the weekend for dinner. Was fairly full but there were a few tables open so was lucky to be seated right away. The server took the order and we got the Southwest Flatbread to start.\n","\n","The Southwest Flatbread came out in a reasonable time. It has chicken, bacon, and topped off with delicious sauces. Everything goes well with one another. Definitely recommended IF you do come here.\n","\n","For my main, I had the steak and veggies. I substituted the veggies for cactus cut potatoes. And this is where it starts to go downhill.\n","\n","The steak is a   New York strip loin. I had it medium rare and it was pink inside (y). However for some reason it was very bland. Had little to no taste at all. Even if it had some charring on the outside would had helped it greatly. I know it's questionable for someone to eat steak at a pizza\n","place and after all it's $ , but still. \n","\n","The cactus cut potatoes was a mistake. It too was bland. But worse it was quite tough and the texture felt very stale. Kind of like when you are at a Chinese restaurant and you have crispy chicken with the coloured chips.. And the chips aren't fresh. It was like that or eating cardboard.\n","\n","The mashed potatoes were okay. Nothing to rave about here.\n","\n","After \"finishing\" the main, decided to have dessert. Took a little while to flag down the server to order the chocolate brownie which comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. \n","\n","Then an even greater wait began. It probably took at least   to   minutes before the dessert came out. Not sure if this is normal for the dessert to take so long. I personally felt it was unreasonable.\n","\n","Anyway when the dessert finally came, we asked for the bill right away since the dessert took forever to arrive. It seemed like it was a difficult night to get a hold of anyone. It was during the dinner rush, but I did not feel it was chaotic. There was no sense of urgency. \n","\n","I must admit the brownie was warm when it finally arrived. Perhaps they make/bake it to order and hence the lengthy wait? The ice cream is really good, but the brownie is very sweet. Overall it is a good dessert, but absolutely not worth the   to   minute wait.\n","\n","We finish what we can with the dessert and tried to find our server or anyone so we can pay and get the heck out. You would think since we asked for the bill right when we got the dessert it would suggest we are ready to pay asap. Nope not tonight. After a good five minutes go by, I gave up and decided to go right up to pay. Found our server on the side. She was chatting with another server. \n","\n","Overall it was quite the negative experience for me. My main course was subpar. The starter and dessert were above average. But the real kicker was the service. It's not that the staff or our server was rude, but the service was non existent when we actually needed it. Like when we wanted a dessert menu to order more food, or to pay for our meal. Oh and did I mention the lengthy wait for dessert? I was actually kind of struggling to decide if this will be a   or   star rating. The ambiance is actually not bad and the decor looks nice inside. Looks-wise, it would be a decent place to watch the game or have drinks. But usually when I am stuck on a rating it comes down to service.\n","Alrite! A food buddy of mine drove to my work place, kidnapped me for a ride and drop me off @ a Food Truck named Le Tigre Cuisine. It was a good surprise, the place deliver Western Fusion Taiwanese style street food. The Main chief is a charmer, despite not being as charming as I am, he does definitely knows better on the cooking side of life.\n","\n","So for you foodies who misses the Taiwanese street food, this place could get that craving temporarily satisfy. For those who work in Downtown. They will be hosting the food corner @ Alberni St and Bute St every Thursday. It will become the weekly reward you get to have for grinding pass that hump day. for their other location, please use the following URL:  \n","\n","most of their items are   dollar snacks, so you get to order   dishes for the price of   dollar (after tips and taxes). fairly acceptable ~ I can't go home and cry about it. \n","\n","here is what I share with my friends today:\n","\n"," ) Kumquat and Basil seed juice... better than bubble tea if you are looking for something light and refreshing for the summer~ recommend? yes, repeat, of coz\n","\n"," ) Kickass Rice with pork belly....alrite, this guy know what's up, the poach egg just bends the dish together like symphony and hug, it's amazing. The pork belly has the right balance of fat and meat..sweet jesus...this stuff is da SHITTTTTTT! \n","\n"," ) BBQ pork steamed bun....this is where you tell them to shut up and take your $$$, just order   and take a bite before you leave the line-up, you might just want another. Very spam-able, so watch out if you are on a diet or something silly like that.\n","\n"," ) Miso Salmon Chowder.....solid...nothing crazy..won't really start dancing on the street after I have it. But definitely worth a try if you enjoy a wild spectrum of seafood soup\n","\n"," ) Angry kittycat square...screw up names, but whatever.....think of it as a deep fired risotto dish, it is well made...won't repeat but you should sure give it a shot, the texture is very well deliver but you should wait for the temperature to cool down a bit so you can enjoy it without burning your tongue. \n","\n"," ) last and pretty sure it is my least favorite of them all....warm Brussel sprout and cauliflower salad.. it is not that I don't enjoy my salad..I was actually really looking forward to this dish... the idea is GREAT..traditional Taiwanese street food with a twist, but unfortunately, it was way over season imo. But there is always a upside, due to it being over season, I can see it as a very good snack when you have a little too much to drink :-) ~ for those who have the privilege to get hammer on a Thursday afternoon, congratulation, you can finally stop eating those shitty pizza @ Megabite \n","\n","Have fun with it, but  ,  and   is a must, if you have to skip a meeting for it, so be it.\n","I recently had the pleasure of coming here for dinner, not knowing what to expect, this was just going to be like any every other dinner I've had at these types of restaurants, I left being blown away and having to say this was the best full on Cantonese style dinner I have had in years. I have never been to the former restaurant that used to be here (Lucky Tao) with it's tacky yellow signage... all that is gone, and when you enter here, all the inside has been redone. What you are sitting in is a very modern, high end seafood restaurant, like Kirin, Sun Sui Wah, Fisherman's Terrace.... you get the idea.\n","\n","Each table's dining wear, crisp white plates stacked, cups, chopstick holders, clearly wiped wine glasses, finely pressed table clothes and cloth napkins, big comfortable chairs, if you needed to be impressed, this place has the look and feel, but is this a smoke-screen show to hide what lacked in dinner, I was soon going to find out. The first order of business is when the waiter came over to offer a hot towelette to each person, and on the table was a seperate plate for you to put this after you cleaned your hands. Wine was opened up and poured and the food was to be coming soon.\n","\n","The first dish we had was an order of roasted squab (pigeon), perfectly seasoned, with a touch of crispyness on the skin, and tender juicy meat within. How funny that this restaurant is right across Sun Sui Wah.. which proclaims they have the bests squab in town. I've had this dish since I was a child... and I proclaim this place way better than across the street. No seasoning salts, or sauces needed, what you see is what you eat, I was picking the bones clean on this little birdie!\n","\n","The next dish was a stir-fried fresh live tomato based prawn dish. Beautifully presented in a spiral on the plate, and topped off like a pyramid, the tails all facing outward, the chef definitely understands presentation. Each prawn was cooked perfectly, and you didn't have any dead, soggy, mushy prawn meat, each one was firm, with a rubbery bounce, the internals of the heads were lightly revealed, I had more than a few.\n","\n","The crab came next, perfectly cooked, deep fried, topped off with deep fried garlic flakes, another showing that the chef knows what he is doing. More fresh seafood meat, there was this sweetness you only get from something that was live, had a slight spice to it, but even the deep frying didn't take away from the tenderness of the meat.\n","\n","Other dishes that came, like a tour-de-force, stir fried garlic pea shoots (greens needed), braised duck with taro root... this was massive, with some big chunks.. of not just duck meat, but taro root, all the flavors went right into the root and everything was cooked just right. A dish of marinated beef bits, and to finish this all off... fried rice with scallop and egg, finely diced gai-lan bits, green onions. There was six of us, and we practically polished off all the dishes, clean.\n","\n","The service here is spectacular, this place doesn't play off trying to be high end, this is high end dining with every plate being cleaned off (personal plates) in front of you gearing up for the next plate. Water was always topped off for our tea, wine glasses were consistently refilled without us even noticing, and even at the end we had a birthday cake brought, and the staff came over to sing the customary medley.\n","\n","I usually feel bloated and in some sort of coma hoping to just lie on a couch, I had no feeling of this after all I ate, I felt good, and our party was still talking about this meal a few days later. I have no doubt I will be back, hopefully to try their dim-sum, but for now.. I hope to come back for dinner soon enough and bring other people to enjoy this gem!\n","A return visit after   years and we were in need of dinner and we thought why not, thinking of the normal staple here we thought we were planning to order. I remember the place used to be called McNoodle and looking at things they changed it to MaxNoodle, they should just go to the original name when they first started Mak's Noodle, but they probably want a more mainstream name! It was dinner time and this place was getting busy. We were told to seat ourselves at the small two seat table near the washroom, and we were presented our menu's quite quickly.\n","\n","Besides us, sitting at the same time was a table of  , and judging by how the man was ordering in Cantonese, he comes here quite often. While I was looking at the menu he was ordering claypot rice, almost one of each without looking at the menu! I looked at the back page, and there it was,   choices, and under it in big letters: Cooking Time:   minutes - Available:  :  p.m. -  :  p.m. daily, so your not getting this at lunch, and if you come too late.. your not getting it either, just have your stomach prepared and don't be b*tching that you had to wait, cause even I have to say, this is worth it. So the two of us decided, first to order a bowl of flat rice noodle with wonton's and dumplings, and an order of the pot rice with Chinese sausage, dried pork & duck leg. The order was put in, the wait begins!\n","\n","While we waited the first thing we noticed with our senses was the scent of the rice coming from the claypots in the back of the kitchen spreading all over the restaurant, this was a very comforting smell, like being at home waiting for dinner. First came the noodles, you couldn't see any of the dumplings, as they were hidden under the thinly cut rice noodles. Underneath were   wonton's and   dumplings, we picked away at the bowl, and the staff prior to our meal brought out sharing plates and bowls. We took our sauce dishes and put some of the hot sauce that was on the table to use on the dumplings, carving out each with our chopsticks, and the mixture of meat, fungi, bamboo, and the thin wrapping skin was real good, and enhanced better with the hot sauce. The wontons however weren't as good as before, they felt limp, the shrimp were smaller. The soup was real clean, and you can taste the seafood that was used to cook this. Usually, as in the past I would have the 'MSG' headache from having a bowl from here, but not today, to the point we polished off this bowl with no soup broth remaining.\n","\n","The star of the show decided to show up at our table in   minutes (they weren't joking!) and prior to this, they brough over the sweetened dark soy sauce that is supposed to go over the rice. The clay pot was put in the centre of our table, lid removed, steam just coming out, and the top covered with all the mixed meats listed on the order, you could barely see the rice under. I decided to take the bowl of soy sauce and pour it all over, and the crackling, cooking sound, with another whif of steam errupted from the pot! We waited a few minutes to let the soy sauce form with the bottom as the crackling continued, and my dear decided to take the metal spoon and dig in. They use long grain rice, and there was no soggyness, as everything was cooked to perfection, without event putting the lid back on, we just let it sit in the open. Every bite, from the rice to the meat on top was perfect. When I started using the metal spoon to dig at the rice sticking to the pot, there was a crispy shell, which surprised me fully, and I haven't seen one like this in a long time. All three of the meats from the Chinese sausage, the liver sausage, and the duck were just so good, to the point there wasn't enough of the rice.\n","\n","The only thing that was missing from this pot that I only thought about afterwards was lack of any greens, there was none! This by far, and I'm saying this right now, is the best claypot rice in the city, the best, no-one else comes close. I was working like a gold miner using the metal spoon to chisel away at the remaining crispy rice that was attached to the claypot - that's how good it was. I will be back now, but not for the wonton noodles! You can't go wrong when a table of  , beside us, practically only order claypot rice, so a change of identity on the signature dish of this place is in order!\n","This review is strictly for the RICHMOND location:\n","\n","Humm...sometimes a name with reputation after years and years of serving the community can disappear overnight!\n","\n","Case in point, Happy Day Cafe in Richmond has been serving the local community for years and years, I recall, even a lot of non-profit community agencies order from them for pot-luck and other functions as the Old Boss was very community minded and friendly and of course the price very down to earth and affordable.\n","\n","Fast forward to present, when the old location has been demolished for a new residential high rise, they moved to the current location; within a new shopping mall, the decor is very nicely done and modern. Tables are small when considering a table for two cannot really hold all the things when your meal arrive, as there is already a condiments basket, a menu stand  occupying the space etc.\n","\n","Anyways, the current menu does not reflect the original HDC at all, for example \"Snack\" menu items are average $  or $  each without drink included ( and if you order for take out a surcharge of $ .  is added ). \n","\n","I am not saying that they are over priced but if their food standard is better I would not hesitate to pay, but my first test of their food does not give me a reason to go back, at least for a while.\n","\n","Items ordered:\n","\n","Deep Fried Chicken Leg with Fruit Salad:  $ .  + $ .  for a cold drink\n","I have never had a fried chicken this dry!  Its so dry that I can't even use my knife to cut it apart and my teeth to bite into it! Also, the fruit salad only consist of Honey Dew & Cantaloupe mixed with mayo, and both were not ripe at all and tasted horrible!  I sent my dehydrated chicken back and the server was kind enough to offer me another one, the second one was also very dry but compared to the first one it became very juicy!\n","\n","Shanghai Fried Noodles: Nothing to write home about it was just a mix of ingredients without any trace of being pan fried properly!\n","\n","Iced Lemon Tea: The tea came in plastic cups that people use for BBT, I really don't understand the logic behind it, as it is totally not environmental but when you get it you cannot even squeeze the lemon, as it is sealed and the straw they gave you is too thin to poke the lemon slices. Also, they did not ask us if we wanted it to take out, and just brought us the tea in a plastic cup with straws.\n","\n","Too bad that this place used the name of Happy Date! There is totally no trace of the old Happy Date that we grew up with in Richmond!\n","\n","P.S.: the table next to us also commented that the Pineapple Bun ( which they are supposed to be famous for ) is very very DRY as well and they did not even finish the ones they've ordered, their Curry Beef Brisket was sent back to the kitchen as it was stone cold when it arrived!\n","\n","To be totally fair, I am usually not this harsh when I go to HK Style Cafes, as usually prices are reasonable and you do not expect to have a   Star Chef cooking all the dishes for you, but if they are charging average per person $  to   and dinner even higher prices (see menu), I will have some expectation! \n","\n","Very sad to see such a reputable name being used, and destroyed!!\n","Sometimes you get a craving for some fried chicken. You've just got to have it. Based on where I'm situated, Zabu, Boom Beer and all the others are a bit of a drive, so imagine my surprise when I noticed on my Facebook feed that a new Korean Chicken place had opened up just a short drive from my place.\n","\n","Cocoru Chicken & Beer  is nestled right in that Richmond strip amongst a variety of other Asian cuisine. What makes it stand out from the other chicken places is that it is clean. Not to say that others are dirty, but they certainly have a more 'worn in feel' sort of like your favourite pair of jeans. This is likely a result of the colours, lighting and being brighter and lighter than others such as Zabu, Ajuker, and Boom. They are definitely going for a more modern/trendy look here.\n","\n","That being said, when you first enter, you are greeted with a wall of action figures ranging from One Piece Dr. Slump, Gundam and various Marvel characters. A nice personal touch, but seems a little out of sort with the rest of the decor in my opinion.\n","\n","Service was fairly attentive. The servers were of varied ethnic backgrounds, they all speak English. My wife and I got ID'd when ordering some beers. My wife didn't bring any ID so that was a no go. Can't really fault them for doing their job, but it seemed like they were asking for ID from every table....\n","\n","In some ways, I feel like this is Korean Fried Chicken for beginners, and I don't mean that in a negative way, but I don't need an explanation of what I ordered when I know what I want. Some things that stand out vs other chicken places. Also, you don't need to ask me if my food is too spicy, when it clearly isn't. I get that it's all part and parcel of trying to provide good customer service, but please let the chicken speak for itself. \n","\n","So how was the food? I'll only comment on the things we ordered.\n","\n","Deep Fried Rice Cake - $ . \n","\n","As it was just the two of us, my wife and I ordered the Deep Fried Rice Cake to start. We got two skewers of rice cakes of   each. These are topped with their yangnyeom sauce and some sesame seeds. The rice cakes are just crispy enough on the outside but remain soft inside. The sauce has a bit of kick to it, but nothing to make you reach for the water. Would I get them again? I think so, the price point is fairly attractive, and my wife enjoyed them enough to the point where she still had a good impression of them as I write this review.\n","\n","Snowfall Chicken - $ . \n","\n","Honestly a bit different from what I thought I was going to get, but still good. Boneless chicken topped with bechamel sauce and grant padano cheese. I don't think another chicken place in the lower mainland has this (from what I have experienced at least). More than enough for two people. Let me start with the chicken. It is very crispy on the outside, but not at all oily. The meat itself is very tender and a pleasure to eat. The two combine for a pleasant experience. When topped with the sauce and cheese it becomes quite filling fairly quickly. Eater beware though, it becomes a bit much about  /  of the way in. This is easily combatted with having something spicy though, so if you are going with a group of people and this is one of the items ordered, order another chicken dish on the side that has a bit of spice to it to balance the flavours.\n","\n","Alternatively you can ask for yangneyom sauce on the side ($ .  extra charge) to combat the rich creamy flavour of Snowfall chicken (especially as you get to the bottom of the dish).\n","\n","While we were there, Cocoru was running a promotion via Facebook, where giving them a like would net you a free can of Coke. Be sure to ask your server about this if they don't mention it, and be sure to 'like' it in front of them so you don't miss out.\n","\n","Overall we are likely to go back and try a few other things on the menu for sure. In the grand scheme of things, you can never have enough quality chicken places and it's nice to see Cocoru make a foray into that field.\n","The restaurant doesn't look very nice from the outside, but I was surprised that the interior is actually pretty nice and well decorated. It's fairly small inside and on a Saturday night, we were lucky to find seats without reservations.\n","\n","We started off with Vegetable Samosas (although we had wanted meat samosas, but they had sold out). It came with two sauces - one being slightly spicy. For $ . , you get two samosas, which is a pretty good deal. The samosas were crispy on the outside and stuffed with peas, potatoes, and spices.\n","\n","MW suggested we try the Lamb Vindaloo. The boneless lamb is cooked in ginger, coconut, vinegar and cream mixed with potatoes. For all the curries, they will ask you how spicy and you can choose from mild, medium, or spicy. We went with medium, but I was surprised it wasn't too spicy. MH commented that this was surprisingly very good. The lamb was tender and the sauce was a nice change from your typical masala or butter chicken.\n","\n","Well we had to get the typical Butter Chicken as well. MH and MW had told me that this was very good at Tandoori Kona. The boneless chicken is marinated in their special buttery sauce, cooked in garlic ginger, and cream. Chicken was well tenderized and the sauce was creamy yet flavourful.\n","\n","All the dishes came with Naan as well, which is baked in a Tandoor oven. I really liked this leavened bread because it didn't feel oily at all! It was much different from the naan I've tried at other restaurants, which are usually drenched in oil. Very fluffy and perfect to pair with all that sauce!\n","\n","I think you get a bowl of rice for each dish you order, so we got   bowls of basmati rice. Rice was fluffy and seasoned with some vegetables. The curries may look small in the bowl, but along with the naan, rice and all the cream that's in it, you actually get really full!\n","\n","The Chicken Tikka featured boneless chicken marinated in yoghurt ginger, cooked in a Tandoor and served with butter sauce. This was slightly more spicy and the chicken was very tender. I thought the sauce was not really necessary since the chicken is already well flavoured.\n","\n","We also got the Mixed Grill (I think it was called a different name on the menu), but the platter featured BBQ chicken, chicken tikka, lamb tikka, fish tikka, and was served with butter sauce. This is great if you haven't tried a lot of their grilled dishes and want a bit of everything. I found that the fish wasn't that great since it didn't seem very fresh.\n","\n","Overall, Tandoori Kona is definitely a hidden gem in Richmond. Prices are reasonable since Indian food is very buttery and you will get very full with the rice and naan. Good idea to come here with a small group of friends so you can share a variety of dishes. However, the restaurant is fairly small, so larger groups may need reservations.\n","\n","Pros:\n","- Great food at reasonable prices\n","- Ambiance is surprisingly quite nice inside\n","\n","Cons:\n","- Service is a bit slow (seems to be run by husband and wife)\n","I was curious as to how this location would differ from the Coquitlam location since I've been there once for their yogurt soju cocktails and bingsoo. Their Richmond location seemed to have a much more extensive menu and seemed really popular judging off social media so I made the assumption that they set the bars quite high with their food.\n","\n","I was late meeting my friends there so they had already gotten a seat. However, I hear wait times can go up to  .  on the weekends so plan accordingly! We decided to start with just the \"Stir Fried Spicy Chicken\" which resembled the hot cheese dipping plate with chicken and egg on the side. Same concept as Tabom (it seems like many Korean restaurants are attempting this new cheese dipping fad!). We also ordered two bowls of rice to share. We were surprised that this Korean restaurant did not have side dishes as well (this is the first I've been to without side dishes). When our plate came, the lady attempted to balance the plate over two burners and we actually thought it was going to tip over. The whole apparatus didn't look safe at all. The bigger problem, however, was that the cheese ended up cooking unevenly. Half of it became burnt while the other half was still uncooked! We had to stir it around to try to distribute the heat. But even then, the cheese had already burned on one side. The egg and corn were pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary. The chicken wasn't anything special either. I tasted more spice than I did flavour. Overall, the entire dish was also very oily and didn't sit too well in our stomachs afterward. After delivering the hot plate, we sat for about   minutes, (occupying ourselves with taking pictures of our food), when we noticed that they probably just forgot our rice (even though we ordered only two items!!). The restaurant by this time had filled up to a full house but there was still a handful of waiters and waitresses but it still took us a while to flag someone down to remind them of our rice. When the rice came, we also realized it was a lot harder (not sure if it has been sitting out for a while or if it was just undercooked). In the middle of our meal (there was still food on the hot plate), we had turned our burners off since it was over cooking our eggs and cheese in unequal parts. A server came along and asked if we were still using it? We told him we weren't so he proceeded to take the burners and bring it to another table? Taking a look at their menu, it seems like the majority of their food items require burners so I'm unsure of why a new restaurant would not stock enough to assume each table requires a hot plate. After he had taken our hot plates, our cheese ended up hardening (this was the non-burnt cheese) and also became inedible. Overall, we were unhappy with the food.\n","\n","Onto the service. As mentioned above, it took us a while to even wave anyone down for our forgotten rice. Ontop of that, it took us a while for someone to refill our jug of tea (mind you, it was a JUG, so we only needed one refill which they didn't even come around for!). Then, not surprisingly, we had to wave someone down again to get our bill in the end. Overall, also unimpressed with the service especially since this location is relatively new! \n","\n","Would I return? No. \n","Would I recommend to a friend? No.\n","I enjoyed my experience when I had visited the Coquitlam location long ago but this visit really turned me off of visiting Midam at all. Hopefully these are just little things that will be fixed since it is relatively new.\n","Dinesty (Gilbert Rd)\n","\n","Last visit  / / \n","\n","Full disclosure, I didn't mind the one at Aberdeen ( .  stars,  . / , now closed.) but I strongly dislike the one on No   & Acroyd Rd (both times we tried it was disgutingly oily, I've never had desire to try them again.  .  stars,  . / ) so we had to try here to see if it was more the former or the latter.\n","\n","Xiao long bao - XLB (pork soup dumplings)... Nowhere near the succulent ones at Top Shanghai (Acroyd Rd); which tasted identical to the World-famous ones at the temple district if Shanghai, but better than food court quality. Both the soup and pork were underseasoned, but at least they tasted fresh and non-oily.  .  stars.\n","\n","Chive dumplings: not bad, pretty clean. Pan fried dumplings similar to the pan fried pork soup buns, minus the pork and the soup.  .  stars.\n","\n","\n","Shredded pork w/ hoi sin sauce & pancakes; actually crepes. Wrapping proteins in crepes is a common thing in Chinese cuisine; the flavour was very good; although the pork was a hair overcooked, it wasn't enough to detract from the dish. There was a lot of leftover pork (not enough crepes) so we had to order an additional order of pancakes for $ . . The crepes themselves were perfect, and incredibly consistent  .  stars.\n","\n","Shirmp and pork shaomai (xiao mai or siu mai) is a bit of a misnomer; these are essentially xlb with a small shrimp on top, minus the soup. Fortunately, these are better than their xlb.   stars. A larger prawn would've made all the difference.\n","\n","Hot & sour wontons: similar to other Shanghainese spicy wonton, but the additional dimension of sour in the flavour profile made this more appetizing than I expected. While I prefer the spicier ones at other places, the slightly milder ones here allowed the Mrs to actually enjoy them; usually they're too hot for her to enjoy.  .  stars\n","\n","Since they have the Coconut tapioca (sago) that I've been pining for since Fisherman's Terrace removed it from their menu. The coconut milk was as good as the best I've had; the sago (tapioca) was a great texture and consistency, but hadn't absorbed enough flavour from the coconut.  . -  stars.\n","\n","Since I got a dessert, the Mrs ordered dessert for herself in the form of taro buns. They were moist and tasty; taro doesn't have the most intense flavour, so these buns were also fairly mild.  .  stars.\n","\n","Overall my favourite Dinesty so far; however a tad pricey; our meal for   was $ .  before tips, and we had only a little leftover (just a bit of the pork crepes) Top Shanghai still sits as the best locally. Having said that, this is the closest you can get to dim sum for dinner in Vancouver.\n","\n","  stars,   . / \n","\n","Recommended: Coconut tapioca, hot & sour wontons, shrimp xiao mai, shredded pork & pancakes.\n","\n","Avoid: nothing yet at this branch; at most other branches I'd avoid anything fried or the Shanghainese pan fried noodles; other branches are too oily, but this one surprised me.\n","**** Note added later:  Shun Feng closed for a period of several weeks and I have not been back since they re-opened yet. So I don't know if this review still stands or not. ****\n","\n","Ok, I've been hunting around for my favourite dim sum in the Vancouver area and I think I have finally found it!  I'm excited!\n","\n","Located in one of the older Richmond Malls (Parker Place), Shun Feng is on par with some of the better dim sum spots in Hong Kong.  Their selection is heavily weighted towards seafood, and offers a really large selection of steamed dumplings.  (I tend more towards the steamed than the fried, and many of the other places in Vancouver don't have enough steamed variety for me).  \n","\n","The highlights of today's meal included:\n","\n","- Lobster and shrimp dumpling:  which was beautifully presented in an open square fold, with the lobster sitting on top of the shrimp filling.  The lobster had a small cilantro leaf and some fish eggs as decoration.  \n","\n","- Scallop on egg tofu had a fresh scallop on top of dried scallop on top of a smooth egg tofu.  The flavour combination of the fresh and dried scallop was brilliant.  \n","\n","- Crab and winter melon dumpling was beautifully formed with the crimped edge dipped in crumbled egg yolk.  The crab meat and winter melon were enhanced by a slight herbal flavour.  \n","\n","- Hargow were perfect with juicy succulent shrimp and a slight hint of ginger to accent the natural sweetness of the shrimp.  \n","\n","- Shrimp and chive cheong fun gave an alternate presentation of the same lovely shrimp.  The wrapper had the perfect consistency, holding together yet still being tender.  It was plated nicely with some green veggies, which just highlighted the attention to detail they offer here.  \n","\n","- Pea shoots and egg whites were perfectly tender, while remaining crunchy.  \n","\n","- Haam sui gaau (deep fried country style dumplings) were the most creative presentation I've ever seen.  They had shaped the dumpling into a stubby carrot shape and added a little orange colour and stuck a piece of parsley in the top to make each one look like a little carrot.  The attention to detail in preparing this item highlights the seriousness of their food preparation.  The pork inside was tender and flavourful, and the rice flour had just the right sweetness.  They were not greasy at all.  Perfect!  \n","\n","I was disappointed that they were out of chicken knees unfortunately.  But I look forward to trying them there on a future visit.  The lightness of the   fried item we had makes me think the chicken knees would be excellent as well.  \n","\n","One odd thing on the bill - the first line was a charge for tea of $ /person (which is common and I didn't think much about it) and the very last line was a subtraction of the charge for tea entitled, \"Free tea.\"  Huh?  Were we supposed to feel special?  No free dessert, but free tea.  Oh well.  Just thought it was kind of an odd way to present it.  But I would have been happy with paying the tea fee if they just left it on the bill too.  \n","\n","Service was also extremely professional, efficient, and friendly.  I've got my new dim sum favourite spot, and finally have found one in the Vancouver area that I feel comfortable giving   stars to.  I just hope they are consistent the next time I visit!  If they are, they have a customer for life!\n","Far be it for me to question the review gods when they speak. However, man is just that, man, and man while made in the image of the god(s) he/she was also given free will and with that the ability to deny gods. Lesson learned... LISTEN TO GOD.\n","\n","For you non-religious types, let me re-explain my position in a less dramatic and less theological manner. When a restaurant's reviews (and a lot of them) are questionable, chances are better than good you're going to have a questionable experience. It gives me great faith when these realities are as certain as death and taxes.\n","\n","So why the long lead in, well, a while ago, I was visiting friends in Richmond and the Blue Canoe was the destination of choice for supper. Cool, seafood on the water, in BC? Yeah that sounds like fun, but just like that time back in college where you hooked up with that person you had a bad vibe about, only to wake up the next morning itchy, I had a bad feeling about Blue Canoe when I looked at their reviews...\n","\n","Upon arrival I was taken aback, the view around the Blue Canoe was just breathtaking. Truly something amazing. We had a good sized group and a reservation and took up a good portion of the rear dining room.\n","\n","Our server arrived and introduced himself, nice chap, and we decided to order a series of shareable appetizers to split amongst the table, along with a round of drinks. There were several orders of ceviche, pickle chips, haddock and chips, Brussels sprouts and even oysters for some (me). This is pretty much where the wheels started to fall off this wagon. Drinks came out, and ice tea was brought out for one of our group but it was left on the back of another tables booth, and there was some confusion about who ordered what.\n","\n","Over to the sharable portions, the top performers were the ceviche and the oysters - neither one really requiring that that much hands on work from the kitchen. As for any of the cooked items, I think someone really likes their food well done. Brussel sprouts 'had' some sort of seasoning to them but that was masked by the char from being over cooked and burnt. The pickle chips were just chips and required a heafty amount of dip to be edible. And the fish, while moist inside, the batter had been cooked to a point of dark brown as opposed to light golden brown. This could be a by product of either dirty oil OR what I assume was over cooking.\n","\n","For my main, there was a house special for the night that sounded just wonderful. A Thai curry filled seafood style hot pot which was supposed to come with an assortment of fresh seafood, cooked with said curry inside a phyllo pastry topped bowl baked in the over. Yum, right? Not so fast, you forgot the wheels were shaky right? Yep, this is where they fell the EF off. My food was the last to arrive, NBD, and when it did it look yummy! I excitedly poked through the pastry and... nothing. The bowl was about   filled with what appeared to be mostly yellow curry broth. I reached in to grab a lone shrimp and my fingers made contact with something freezing cold - yes the veggies inside were still cold. I then grabbed the shrimp and pulled it to my mouth only to see as the curry ran off of it that the shrimp too was  % uncooked. Barf.\n","\n","I immediately summoned the waiter and showed him, his response was immediately apologetic and offered to \"take care of it right away\". Great! Happy, with his response and then overjoyed when he brought me a complimentary Caesar salad to make up for it, I was more than happy to wait. About  -  minutes later he came back with a piping hot brand ne... errr, same dish as I had before? - with a hole in the philo right where I had left it before. \n","\n","Seems like without asking my preference he had the staff toss it back into the oven and give it a quick nuke to bring the internal temperature of the \"soup\" up while burning the old philo on the top. I was shocked. Isn't the SOP (standard operating procedure) to automatically make a brand new dish for the customer or at least ask if they'd like it warmed up or something new. One of my friends asked the question I was too shocked to ask myself, and the server said \"yes we warmed it, should I not have served it?\" Well if you don't know I really cannot tell you. Game over.\n","\n","They receive partial marks for location, setting, and some of the appetizer courses we had but zero marks for everything else. Average,   star. Would I return here? Nope. Should you go there? I don't know, I don't pretend to be a god or anything but maybe let's just say you trust the review of a friend you've never met before?\n","\n","Eatcrest (looking) Out ( ).\n","Hidden restaurant right above a complex with other stores and restaurants.  Thankfully the garage for this place was free unlike most other restaurants.  The place was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait for a table, but there was this rude lately that waltzed in and started speaking to the hostess in their language.  Instead of the hostess seating us, they had a full blown conversation for  -  minutes, while we stood there.\n","Finally seated, we received some hot tea, paper, pencil, and a menu.  They did not have most things I've had at other dim sum places back in the states.  Most of the waiters didn't know any English and I believe it was the manager that had to assist us throughout our meal. \n","\n","Typically we eat dim sum with soy sauce.  Here you have to request for it, because I guess they don't eat it that way over here.  They don't have sate, so don't bother asking.  That was a super downfall for us!\n","The menu was pretty simple, just check whatever you want and hand it to them.  Simple!\n","\n","--Har Gao ( / ) - I loved the starch, tasted like it was made to order along with the shrimp.  It tasted very very fresh made with top of the line shrimps.  Lol.  No, but really.  The texture in this was all amazing all in one bite.\n","--Sui Mai ( / ) - Meat on this was very fresh as well.  I loved how they topped this was caviar, not many places do this. The caviar made the Sui mai crunch and it wasn't fishy at all.  It doesn't have the old meat smell you would have like other places.  Most places are overcooked, old, or frozen.\n","--Steamed Wild Mushroom Dumplings w/ Black Truffle ( / ) - I loved the inside of the dumpling, which was the black mushroom with truffle.  I hated the glutinous starchy flour to this.  If you've ever had a Vietnamese thing called Banh Bot Loc, the starch is almost made the same except this was wayyyy more stretchy and chewy.\n","--Steamed Chicken Feet w/ Chuhou Sauce ( / ) - Flavoring was not too bad, a little savory, and a small hint of sweetness.  They steamed this to wear the skin falls off which is always best.  I prefer my chicken feet a little more sweeter, but it was still good.\n","--Deep Fried Beancurd Sheet Puff w/ Wild Mushroom in Abalone Sauce ( / ) - I requested fried tofu and the guy recommended this.  Technically this wasn't the tofu I was looking for, but it was still good.  Came with delicious vegetables and the sauce on here was a little thick and went great as a stir fry!  The beancurd has a thick skin fried all around with soy bean inside soaked in all of the ingredients.\n","--Stir Fried Turnip Cake ( / ) - Usually turnip has a bit tougher texture, but this had a very mushy texture inside like taro cakes.  Unique dish, had a hint of spice, bell peppers,  bean sprouts, and small fried egg strip along with this.  I was looking for \"pan fried turnip cake\", but this was as close as I could get to one of my favorite dish. \n","\n","This was a different experience for some dim sum, from some of the dishes I'm use to, requesting soy sauce and sate, to waiters that can't really understand you or speak to you.  During the meal, waiters didn't come by which had some pros and cons with that.  I've heard Vancouver had some great dim sum places and I am glad I got to try it.  Everything was really fresh to my palate!\n","I visited the lounge after the Night Market since it was one of the few places that open late and serve alcohol. \n","\n","Space: Massive. It is definitely a stunning place to hang out or party in so one star goes there. We (  people in total) were seated on the elevated booth. There was music playing but the place was dead for a Saturday night. The TVs were on culinary shows or fashion shows. The bathrooms are clean with the lack of toilet paper holders. It's freaky how you can see yourself do your own business in the stalls. \n","\n","Service: sub par by consensus. The servers were dressed well, had earpieces to talk to other staff and glowing name tags. I wish I knew their names but I can't read Chinese. They didn't greet most of us or graced our table for the first  -  minutes despite us trying to wave them over. Perhaps since gratuity was automatic that they felt that serving properly us would be an extra limb. It was definitely hard to order and it wasn't because of the volume. As the only non Chinese girl in the group, I was ordering in English and my server was looking at the menu as if my items didn't exist. They also missed my friend's drink order (martini) who even triple-checked the order. My drink took ages to arrive for a dead night. They're stingy on the napkins for a seemingly upscale place. The language barrier is sizable when you can't speak Mandarin.\n","\n","They get one star after my glass was toppled over (chain reaction of plates being moved and my glass was on an uneven surface) and my barely touched Lavender milk tea spilled everywhere, including myself and the guy next to me. We weren't offered more napkins. :( They cleaned it up and replaced the drink sans whipped cream. Although I didn't want that accident to happen, some decent service resulted from it. \n","\n","Food: I came from Night Market that night and they were charging serious $$$ for their food so high expectations. Where do I start? They charge a lot for milk tea on a tall glass that's smaller than Bubble World oz cup. They don't have pearls. I would've paid to have them added and justified their horrible service times. I ordered the big tofu plate and I only tasted chili. I tried the tofu and it was bland. The pork bits were either bacon or really thin belly slices that were oily, which was a ripoff for a $ -  dish. I wish it came with rice...and it's hard to ask for a server when they're not around. \n","\n","One friend ordered the chicken curry and his brother ordered the calamari. Chicken curry was meh for them and possibly my second gripe goes to the calamari. Let's just ignore the incorrect way they battered and fried the squid but they served it with ketchup. Opa! Greek fast food gives tzatziki sauce and other places offer marinara sauce or jalapeno mayo/ranch. Why give ketchup, especially when they're charging more than a fast food chain? Another friend ordered the jellyfish dish and it came with more garlic cloves than jellyfish.\n","\n","My friends and I were pretty patient with this place but most of them were visibly displeased. Oh well. It's just one of those times. \n","\n","Overall the portions were small except for mine.  Perhaps my group and I were gluttons and maybe I wasn't part of the demographic of targeted diners... but the place needs some serious internal work.\n","Neptune Bistro - winner of my worst meal in  \n","\n","My first visit was back in   when I ordered a mushroom and chicken rice plate. I am sure no other Chinese restaurant will cook this dish because it's too simplistic. Consisting of stir fried rice topped with lettuce, button mushrooms, and chicken slices, this dish is most likely found at college apartment kitchens or prepared when the refrigerator is nearly empty and a hodgepodge of leftover ingredients are thrown together at the last minute before a grocery run. It tasted somewhat homecooked, lightly salted, easy on the oil. However, not worth $ .\n","\n","Fast forward   years, and I walked through Neptune's door again, this time for an office lunch. The colorful signs outside advertise Neptune as a European and Mediterranean bistro that also specializes in east Indian cuisine. There were also posters of some Americanized-Asian dishes taped on the wall. Unique combination.\n","\n","One positive comment I have about this visit - the owners are a super friendly husband and wife tandem with positive attitudes. Everything else was close to a failure.\n","\n","Neptune suffers from a lack of identity. Their menu is way too diverse. When you see the lunch special combo #  consists of wonton soup and one samosa, you can tell that they are trying too hard to be a \"jack of all trades\" cafe. In the same meal, you can also order a lamb gyro, egg drop soup, fettucini, \"Indian\" curry, salmon fried rice, cheeseburger, ciabatta panini, Sicilian wrap, yakisoba, and Singapore fried noodle, all prepared by the chef who also happens to be a cashier.\n","\n","I ordered the vegetable curry and naan since it was highlighted on the menu. The chef confirmed that it was an \"Indian style\" dish. When it came out, it was not anything remotely close to an Indian-style korma from any region of India. I did not expect the curry to be thick and tomato-based. It had zero Indian flavors, was cooked with no spices, simply frozen vegetables stir fried in a sweet tomato puree. To make matters worse, this meal did not include basmati rice, but rather I was given a bowl of jasmine rice with salt and green onions sprinkled on top. At that point, I was expecting the naan to be a complete failure....and to no surprise it was. Neptune served pita bread and boldly told me it was plain naan. One piece of pita bread heated up, sliced into four heterogeneous pieces, and sprinkled with salt. Is this a joke? I want my $  back.\n","\n","Before the owners at Neptune Bistro list Indian dishes on the menu, they are better off dining at Indian restaurants to familiarize themselves with the cuisine. There is no excuse to cook vegetable curry and naan completely different from the rest of the world. This was an example of owners having no idea what they are doing. They are even better off microwaving packaged frozen meals for recipes they do not have experience cooking.\n","\n","Some of my coworkers were more fortunate than I was, since they had ordered panini and sandwich combos with soup. Those items seem to be the safest choices at Neptune. \n","\n","I was very confused with Neptune's cooking philosophy, which did not seem to be consistent with their WIFI password. The password is \"madefreshforyou\", but Neptune operates two microwaves in their kitchen. I am not sure how much of their food is actually cooked or prepared from scratch. I did hear the microwave ring several times just before the sandwiches and soups were brought out. Only the Singapore noodles and the curry were stir fried from what I observed.\n","Undecided which restaurant  to go for VDO, so we decide to try  Cavu, the menu looks promising and good and its $ . , so why noT. \n","\n","The restaurant  is located inside Hilton Hotel in Richmond. They offer a compLimentary parking for two hours (free parking such a bonus)\n","\n","The resto  itself lookS cozy, neat and clean. The staff were friendly.   There's only few people dining in, which was very nice. Some places can be very busy and loud. It's just perfect  specially cOming off from work. Its just nice to have a good quiet dinner\n","\n","We had MUssles and corn dOg poppers for appy\n","The portion was reasonable (but not good for shAring) there weRe few empty mussel sHells, i waS hoping the meat waS  mixed in the broth bUt was not. The taste was bland. ( I was thinking A little bit of cream or white winE with leeks or cilantro will help elevate the taste of the  broth and gives more taste to the mussels. In addition,  there will be a great broth to dip the garlic bread) aLthough there's bit of bacon and tomatO  relish it didnt help  boost the flavour. \n","\n","Let's talk about the corn dog- it was a whole hotdog cut up into pieces and dipped in batter. Its noT the traditional \"corn dog\" batter . The mac and cheese saauce was not thin enough to dip them. It was a consistency of a spread (if they are calling it a sauce, its supposed to be pourable or dippable but it turns out to  be thick) and again, it was a bland. It has more macaroni taste (floury taste)the ratio of the macaroni and cheese was not balance. I just hope it was just cheese. The sweet mustard was just okay\n","\n","For Entrees \n","\n","My boyfriend  had the  PORK BELLY with \n","cipollini onions, citrus glaze, braised cabbage, cashew puree. \n","The pork belly was perfectly cooked and the pork skin was deliciusly crunchy  the pork itself was great. The side dishes that  coMEs alOng was a bit of a missed! The braised cabbage taste like a boiled cabbage. Very small portion. The cipollini onions was just an additional garnish  and there was a  dub of cAshew puree served no purpose at all. The citrus glaze doesn't have enough tarTness to cut through the fatty portion of the pork belly.\n","\n","I Had the LAMB SHANK with a side \n","tomato stew, arborio grits, pickled kale slaw, cider gastrique. \n","I regret having this. The lamb  taste gamey. Its like boiled lamb shank. Was so gamey and bland. Just wished that the lamb was stEwed in tomato  rather than having a stewed toMatoes on the side. The arborio grits, why?? It can be served on risotto, why grits. It just added texture but has nO taste. I was hoping the pickled kale and the cider gastrique will hElp with the gaminess of the meat but it didnt. There was a few shrEded kAle and a dash of cider. IT was a boring, not well thought dish. (Im sorry)\n","\n","Lets talk about the dessert\n","We both dEcided to have the WINTER COBBLER. Sounds like wintery to me. The cranberries, apples and cinnamon, you cant go wrong with that but unfortunately there was NO apples, instead they used few strawberries and lots of cranberries. It was very sour. (It serve a a good palate  cleanser after a gamey lamb) but it was too sour)\n","DEspiTe  of the vannilla gelato and  creme anglaise it didnt help with the tartiness of the dish. The sourness makes me scrunched up. \n","\n","The overrall experience was okay. The menu  needs to be re-thought again,  IT can be improved and I bet the flavour wilL taste even better. \n","I'd like to eat food that is mEmorable but the dishes servEd were still memorable but  a regrettable memory\n","I hope they will improve the flavour profile I think the Chef has a lo to offer-  just finding the perfect  balance\n","One of Richmond's best all-around Japanese restaurants!\n","\n","Located near the center of the iconic and historic Steveston harbour area, Ichiro Japanese Restaurant is what you would expect a reputable dining establishment to look like - it is a simple, but well-decorated, medium-sized restaurant. I've been coming to Ichiro for at least one full year for lunch and dinner occasions, wanting to sample various items on their menu in order to provide the most comprehensive review that I can. I've brought family and friends on a few occasions, but have mainly eaten here as a solo diner. If you're having a craving for good Japanese food, prepared by Japanese people, with authentic Japanese ingredients and cooking methods, Ichiro should definitely be on your list of places to go!\n","\n","There are a few reasons why I am giving Ichiro a five-star. One of those reasons is the friendliness of the staff. As you step through the welcoming main entrance, you will undoubtedly be greeted by at least one of the many friendly waitresses and staff members that work there. As well, the chefs at the sushi bar will never fail to send a smile your way as you pass by the main area en route to your table. On every one of my visits, the waitresses always seem friendly and happy, checking in with customers during their visit to ensure that everything is going well. The staff are very caring.\n","\n","Another thing that makes Ichiro stand out, in my opinion, is the quality of ingredients. In the past, among other things, I've had the Super Ichiro Don, which is about $ . , but gets you a pretty solid bowl of quality food (unagi, chicken karaage, grilled beef, and shrimp tempura on top of rice); and the tenzaru soba, which is fairly standard, but decently tasting in terms of presentation and taste compared to other restaurants. One of the absolute favorite selections at Ichiro is during lunch time when you have the option to pick a lunch set of two small rice bowls of your choice for about $ . , but I always get the ikura don, which comes with a generous portion of ikura on top of rice, and a mini Super Ichiro Don. You really get your money's worth if you're into that stuff like I am! I really recommend coming here for lunch. The plating and portion sizes are always spot on. By the way, to add, Ichiro is one of the only restaurants in Richmond that offers a decent bowl of ikura on top of rice and, to me, that's a sign of quality.\n","\n","Let's not forget about the sushi now 'cause that's my area of \"specialty\" so to speak haha. I've had a good amount of experience with the menu at Ichiro over the past year, so much so that I can confidently say that the sushi here is among the best you'll find in Richmond. I've ordered the time-tested simple rolls, the Westernized rolls with weird sauce combinations and ingredients on them, and also the traditional nigiri sushi plates. Among my favourite things at Ichiro that are sushi related, there are two: the unagi nigiri sushi, which will absolutely MELT in your mouth the moment it touches your tongue, and the ikura nigiri sushi, which, with every bite, will send your taste buds to cloud nine as you feel the juices from each of the fish eggs explode with depths of flavour. Truly, I can't recommend ordering these pieces enough, and I always make sure to order them myself whenever I visit Ichiro.\n","\n","While Ichiro has definitely earned it's place among Richmond's best, I would be lying if I said every one of my visits were perfect. On one occasion about a year ago when I visited with my mother, brothers, and my uncle, after we were seated we waited about   or   minutes for the waitress to come back and serve us tea and take our meal orders. I remember on that night that it was a fairly busy service with only two waitresses running the whole front of the house. That being said, it was a small thing to pick on, and it happened so long ago that I'm not weighing that part of my visit too heavily on this review. The rest of that particular visit ran smoothly and without incident. Another thing that people might pick on is the price point of their menu. At Ichiro, prices will be slightly higher than at other Japanese places, especially when it comes to their sushi. But honestly, if you don't mind paying a little bit extra, it's not that big of a deal. For me, if I know I'm going to get even just that little extra quality and I know  % that I'm getting what I pay for, I'm gonna do it, no problem. \n","\n","Honestly, almost everything that comes out of the kitchen here is going to be great. Whether you want a small snack or are coming in for a feast with a large party or you're bringing kids in for a simple family meal, Ichiro Japanese Restaurant will accommodate all of your requests with passion and respect. Check them out if you're ever in the Steveston area!\n","I wanted a nice fancy place to celebrate and Dolar Shop was doing a promo for $ .  soup bases, so I thought, why not? There's also a  % discount for their one year birthday for anyone with birthdays in November (offers cannot be combined, which we found out at the end of the meal). We went in early to reserve a spot for later, they were quite helpful but mainly spoke Mandarin.\n","\n","First impressions were that it was spacious and clean, I like brightly lit food establishments that aren't blinding, and they do a good job of it. As we were led to our spots, they explained the layout to us and directed us where the sauce and fruit bar was ($ . /person to access). They provide you with a complimentary sweet soy sauce with chilies, green onion, and cilantro. We got a long explanation of how to order and what to expect, which was quite nice... If I understood Mandarin. Very friendly service though.\n","\n","We first went to the sauce bar and this is definitely worth the extra money, there's a lot of sauces to choose from and good quality too! I was quite disappointed with the fruit selection though, when we got there it was almost all empty. I just really wanted watermelon but had to wait a good hour before it was restocked.\n","\n","We chose the promo two flavor soup base (regular $ . ), one of which had to be Szechuan spicy, so we both got mild, Adorables had the ox tail tomato soup and I got the pepper pork stomach with chicken broth. The mild Szechuan was crazy spicy it was almost painful. We stayed away from it after a couple tries to have it, but the damage was done.\n","\n","The display of food arriving was quite appealing, you can tell there was some thought put into the assembly. Everything was fresh and clean, highlight was the Wagyu slices which the first plate is $ .  and the latter ones $ . . The meat platter ($ . ) was also very good, lots of nicely marbled meat and beautiful presentation.\n","\n","I enjoyed the hand made balls selection ($ . ), all very springy and tasty. Cheese beef ball was my favorite. I was surprised at the mung bean noodles, they were wide thick noodles that soaked up the flavors of the rich broth. Veggie basket was plentiful and fresh, sadly there was still a mosquito in my spinach (I guess it's easy to miss)...\n","\n","I was disappointed with the pork belly, it was too lean and didn't feel like the usual cut. The three colored noodles were also nothing special.\n","\n","I was quite happy with the attention they gave, constantly filling our pots with more bone broth. The watermelon juice ($ . ) was pure watermelon, and helped with the spice a lot! They were very patient and helpful, just wish they didn't assume every Asian person walking in spoke Mandarin, or asked first before going on and on in Mandarin. Otherwise, I enjoyed my experience, we didn't feel rushed at all (stayed for a good   hours just chatting and trying to finish the food I ordered too much of)!\n","\n","Would definitely return again and pray that there's no bugs in my veggies because the food and service were great!\n","Came here at   on a Saturday morning and surprisingly there was quite a few people in the waiting area. Immediately I thought \"Darn it! Should've have made a reservation.\". But fear not, the wait wasn't long. Took us about   mins tops including the wait time for the hostess to appear. Yay!\n","\n","*First odd thing was the hostess asked me what kind of tea I'd like in English. This is the first time someone has spoken to me in English at a chinese restaurant and at dim sum hour too. That's ok. National language of this country is English anyways. I replied back in Cantonese 'cause Steel Goddess didn't exactly sound like a tea.  Not like I wanted jasmine or green tea. She understood.\n","\n","Looked at the menu card and ordered:\n","\n","-Chinese doughnut stuffed with fish paste wrapped in rice sheet ( / ): First time I had this was at Kirin and it was delicious. Been on the lookout for this dish since. Most smaller restaurants don't have this option or I've been going to the wrong places. This dish was lacking in flavour and did not live up to expectation. You do get a generous amount though. \n","\n","-Green Onion Pancake ( . / ): Gave them an extra  .  stars 'cause for some reason this dish tasted a lot better when we took it home. Not sure if it's 'cause the oil soaked in and was less greasy around the mouth or what but that's what we all thought. So it is the dish and not my judgement alone. \n","\n","-BBQ pork Buns ( / ): These were just ok. \n","\n","-Diced Ox Tongue in black pepper ( / ): The ox tongue was less diced than I thought and even though there were lots of celery, there was still a good amount of ox tongue. I'd recommend this dish. Price was decent.\n","\n","-Salted Egg yolk Custard bun ( / ): It was salted for sure. All I tasted was salted lava like goo oozing out from the bun. Never had such a salty custard bun before. Usually it's sweet with a slight saltiness. No for me and the rest.\n","\n","-Deep Fried plain bun ( / ): More like deep fried bread. I was expecting little deep fried man tou's with condensed milk. Nonetheless, it tasted good but not worth it. \n","\n","-Panfried pumkpin mochi with red bean paste ( . / ): I may be bias as I don't like red bean paste to start but the word pumpkin doesn't add much to the taste. Just the color of the mochi. I guess they infused it in the mix. \n","\n","-Rice sheet with beef ( / ): This came way after everything else was on the table. I thought they missed our order. It tasted just ok. \n","\n","*Second odd thing was when I asked for hot sauce. It's my thing for dim sum. I like certain dishes to have a bit of spice to it. \"The lady that brought us our food\" plain out ignored me. That's total rudeness. Giving her the benefit of the doubt (she might not have heard me or maybe I should speak in English), I looked at her and spoke louder. She paused for a second of thought and replied with an unpleasant look on her face \"you have to ask the waitress\". Wait, what? Who? I thought servers and waitress are just interchangeable terms? I thought you were the waitress. I looked around. There's the hostess that brought me in. There's the guy with the suit, presumably the manager. Some picking up plates. Some bringing out food. No clue who she's referring to so I just randomly flagged one of those that were picking up plates to get me my sauce. \n","\n","*Third not so odd thing, manager saw that we needed a refill for a teapot and just zoomed passed our table. Literally had to ask him for a refill when he came back around. This time I spoke in English and he replied back in Cantonese. When we were ready to pay our bill, the lady spoke to me in Mandarin. Didn't understand a word she said. People, please get your languages straight! \n","\n","For bland and mediocre food with higher end price tag and frustrating service I give this place   stars.\n","If it wasn't for their slow service and constantly having to tell them what we wanted I would have given this place a   star. \n","Anyways, was here one night with my boyfrd's family because we heard this place was really good. As their Chinese name stated, they are famous for their Chinese Doughnut. Yummy!!\n","We ordered a full table worth of food which were all really good. Nothing to complain about with the food. We got the sweet Chinese Doughnut wrapped with rice noodle to start (was too hungry to take photos). Man, that was the bomb. It's not something we can find somewhere else and I'm not even sure what it is called to be exact. We ordered the regular chinese doughnut to put in our congee. We ordered   different kind of congee. A chicken one and this other one that I don't remember what it was called. We ordered a noodle and soup dish which was pretty good. It was pretty much what I expect it to be. And we order a bunch of smaller dishes.\n","I also tried out one of their special drinks which was the cream soda with mango ice cream. It was so good. It was like an ice cream float. I recall it costing  . . Which wasn't bad at all considering it was real mango ice cream probably from t and t. hehe. Though next time I might tell them no ice because the ice got in the way and when I was done my drink still had a cup full of ice. \n","Now let me talk to you about service. I personally never expect too much from a Chinese place. Just let me order, get me my food and give me my bill kinda thing. Well that one night, I'm sure this doesn't happen everyday but we asked the same short hair female waitress for   glasses of water like   -   times and she keeps on saying ya I'll get it for you. Never happened and instead she started to serve another table. A table of   who were drinking. I understand that their bill will be bigger than our's but how hard is it to either tell someone else to get us the water instead of brushing us off. When it came to order she brushed us off twice. After that we decided to ask the gentlemen who were working to get our order, get our water and add stuff on the bill. I noticed one thing is when they bring you the fresh deep fried stuff, they cut it right in front of you. Throughout the night, that place wasn't fully packed but yet we still had to tell them to double check our order and make sure the food is still coming. So, that whole part I was unimpressed. But cause the food is good I can look pass it. \n","I recommend others to come try the place out and you will know how good the food is but maybe not get the short hair lady to serve you. She'll probably brush you off if you don't look rich or if you look like you won't tip well. Then again I'm sure the tips are pooled together anyways.\n","We went to Blue Canoe for my son's belated   birthday dinner at his request. He is a foodie and he enjoyed a lunch we had here previously. Grandma was treating. \n","\n","We had a total of   adults and   kids (  of them being only   yrs old). We ordered   of the chilled seafood share platter. The waitress confirmed I wanted  . I replied yes as the menu in front of me says \"$ .  per person, Minimum   people.\" We also ordered a dozen oysters, a crab sandwich,   orders of kids pasta,   glass of wine, and   pint of beer. \n","\n","I never got the seafood tower before. The seafood was very fresh. I was a bit disappointed that the waitress didn't tell me there were already many oysters in the platter and I had ordered a dozen more. \n","\n","NOW comes the PROBLEM. I got the bill. It came to $ . . I was surprised to see:\n","  seafood tower\n","  @ $ .  = $ .  \n","I spent $ .  on   seafood platters. I called the waitress over and asked her why isn't it $ .  as per the menu. She said \"I double checked with you that you wanted   orders. You said yes.\" I told her I wanted   orders as it says minimum   people and each order is $ . . She proceeded to tell me that each \"order\" is good for   people. Hence, the \"customer's\" idea of an order as per the physical menu is $ .  and it is good for   person. However, the \"restaurant's\" idea of an order (which is not disclosed to the customer in writing on the menu or verbally via the service staff at ordering) is $ .  and is good for   people. Hence, I ordered   people worth of food for the platter PLUS the food I already ordered on top. Aren't there ANY red flags why a party of   adults and   kids would order SO MUCH FOOD???\n","\n","The waitress' reply to me was that she didn't want to question my answer of \"yes\" to   orders (which I obviously didn't know was for   x   people) as she said some customers don't like being questioned. She also said she purposely \"asked\" and confirmed the order because previous customers had also had this problem!!! I was livid! Why didn't they change the menu wording then? Or explain verbally that each order is actually good for   people and cost $ .  per order. Are they purposely trying to scam customers since I was not the first patron to have a problem with this? I then asked for the manager and she said there was no manager (it was a busy Saturday night!!!!). \n","\n","I felt I was literally cornered to pay the bill. And the worst of it was grandma was treating. It was good she took the kids out to get frozen yogurt as they became impatient and I paid the bill first (which I never asked her for money back as the whole thing was so embarrassing). The ONLY help the waitress offered me was to write a comment card because the owner reads it. \n","\n","I was so mad and disappointed in my experience at this restaurant. I live near the restaurant and believe in supporting local. However, this is the way they treat those who live near. What is going to happen to their business in the cooler months when all the tourist leave?\n","\n","I gave the restaurant another chance to explain or provide a satisfactory response before I posted any online reviews. I explained I was a local and believe in supporting local business. I told them I wanted to give them a chance to respond before posting a review. I left a comment card and sent a facebook private message to the owner. I even took screen shots of my bill and the menu online (which to this day still says $ .  per person, minimum   people). I have NOT received any reply to this day. Our restaurant visit was on June  .\n","\n","I would say this was a lesson of \"buyer beware\" and I will not set foot back into this restaurant.\n","I love all things matcha, so this spot was a must-try for me. The spot is a little more hidden, as it is not along the main arteries of Richmond - about a  -  minute walk from Richmond-Brighouse Station. It would be a good dessert option to stop by at if you were having dinner around Richmond Centre. I would suggest leaving your car behind at where you had dinner or not taking a car with you as there seems to be only paid parking in the area.\n","\n","First impressions going in was that the space is quite small, with limited seating. They do not differentiate between dine-in or take out orders, unlike some of the other spots around. Everything comes in disposable containers. The menu was simple enough to navigate, with a strong matcha focus (no hojicha softserve). Softserve was offered in matcha, vanilla or twists, which was also topped onto drinks. You can also further customize your soft serve or drinks with topping add-ons, such as azuki, mochi, jelly, etc, for anywhere between   cents to $ . . I thought this was quite a nice option given that a signature parfait that includes all the toppings comes at a hefty price of almost $ . The add-ons kind of let you build your own pseudo-parfait. Not on the menu, but they also have a feature soft serve that is topped with an edible gold sheet. It was only advertised on the blackboard outside the store. \n","\n","I got the pure matcha soft serve and added a mochi ball to it. I liked that the softserve is served on a cone for no additional cost and you can choose complimentary powder topping as well. Options are green tea powder, hojicha powder, or soy powder. The matcha flavour in the soft serve shone through, balancing the sweetness of the creamy soft serve and giving it more depth overall. I added the hojicha powder on top, which gave an added punch of tea flavour. The mochi ball had a good chewy texture to it - it was   cents/ball. I also got to taste the mixed vanilla/matcha soft serve. To my surprise, the vanilla soft serve was equally delicious. It had a very milky taste, yet not too sweet and not too heavy. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with what Maiko offered and will probably look to go back to try some of the drinks in the future. \n","\n","Pricey spot for just softserve, but the prices are pretty on par with the other matcha focused dessert spots in the Metro Vancouver area. Portion sizes were larger than I expected, so the price did not bother me. I would have liked to try the parfait, but high price paired with the fact that they were out of the chestnut, which should be a topping on the parfait, made the $  price tag unjustifiable. \n","\n","Atmosphere was not as nice compared to some of the other matcha dessert spots because they do not have a designated sit down area. However, if you pick the right now and avoid the rushes, its quite nice to sit in-store and enjoy. Seating options included benches inside and outside the store, as well as a couple low coffee tables that seat  -  people, so they are definitely not expecting that you are hanging around for too long. My group was lucky to have gone in before the rush and snag a table to ourselves. We wittnessed the post-dinner rush on our way out. There was a line out the door and the store got quite loud.\n","I still remember when this place opened a few years ago, and coming back again with a friend from Seattle, and New York, who originally is from China, I had to take them to some good eats...... off to Top Shanghai Cuisine! In the last few years there has been a whole lot of 'Shanghainese' themed restaurants popping up everywhere in Richmond, I can name you   places that you can have the infamous XLB in Richmond without pulling out the handy smartphone and even using this app, but I still remember when there were few places, and for 'high-end' there were fewer... except when this one popped up.\n","\n","I haven't come back in here in years (before my Yelp writing days) and I needed to come back to warrant even writing about the place, and finally that time has come. We rolled in at  , so the dinner crowd was either finishing off their last bites, or settling up their bill and we had a table in no time. Usually, the times I have come here, or have driven by, there is a lineup, not too long, but regardless your waiting for good food! The place itself is not that big, and mainly due to the massive round tables in here that take up lots of space, with the chairs, so you may feel a little cramped, we did not as the place was emptying out, but never felt rushed during the whole meal.\n","\n","We had an order of their xiao long bao, which they make in house, as most of these places do now... top notch is the quality here, with a see through sight from the wrapping, where you can see the 'soup' flowing while you carefully pick each individual peice up with your chopsticks. I was not to sure which XLB was ordered (as I wasn't the one calling the dishes) but this one had a distinct crab sweetness flavour to it, something very fresh, yet very foreign, I need to look at the menu, cause this XLB was pure evil joy!\n","\n","Other orders on the night were a mushroom based cleasr broth soup with greens. A dish of pea tip leaves mixed with garlic (one of those favorite expensive green dishes!). A good serving of pork belly, laid on a bed of spinach. This dish was a huge size when it is only   of us eating, where the belly is just staring you in the face, with the glistening layer of tasty fat, while this thing is smothered in it's own marinating sauce, and because this was such a heavy dish we had to order some rice to take on some of the oil. The rice came in it's own wooden container, and when we opened this thing, it had some shreds of pickled cabbage, and meats, to give the rice some extra flavor. This rice was done just write, and the natural oils that eminated from the meats mixed in to give the rice a smooth texture when putting it in your mouth. The other dish we had was a deep fried garlic crab. Clean, and fresh, even though the thing was deep fried, you knew you weren't getting a dead crab, as the meat was still sweet, this was a great meal, and our eyes outdid our stomachs where I had to have most of the food packed and taken home for multiple lunchs/dinners/snacks during the week.\n","\n","I have never come here for lunch, all my meals have been for dinner, and I hope to come again real soon, I just don't want to deal with the lineups. When you come make sure to call ahead, even with all the selection in Richmond, people know a good thing, and that's why people will wait for it, save you the pain, and book it. Don't worry about parking here, cause there is a ton of it, just be prepared to eat some good food and leave smiling, and maybe really full.\n","Yearning for Har Gaw? Craving Cha Xiao Bao? Drooling over dumplings? Who hasn't spent a lazy afternoon or woken up bloody early in their favourite Chinese restaurant sipping tea and feasting over an assortment of Dim Sum delicacies? There is more than just steamers, dough / pastries and steeping teas...\n","\n","What makes a good Dim Sum place? For us it is good quality ingredients, pride in execution, comfortable seating and on top of all good tea. After all. It is called Yum Cha in Cantonese. It is quite discerning if you have a nice piece of shrimp dumpling that is juicy and thin skinned but the cup of tea is bitter of sub-par tea leaves... It is like drinking a fine glass of '  Shiraz but the cheese has turned sour. The pair needs to complement one another...\n","\n","So where do we go for dim sum by default? Red Star Seafood Restaurant is one of the restaurants we find ourselves at a lot in Richmond. After the renovation, I find this place tasting a lot better; however, the fancy the Marpole location slightly more. Their service is pretty friendly and they have killer BBQ duck rice noodle.\n"," \n","\n","\n","Steamed Pork Shui Mai Dumplings\n","\n","More prawns and less pork plus some tobiko sprinkled on top. Super juicy with Chinese mushrooms and skin is thin.\n"," \n"," \n","Steamed Meat Dumplings\n","\n","The skin is thin yet doesn't break or fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. It is filled with nuts, pork meat, mushrooms and cilantro.\n"," \n"," \n","Fried Bean Curd Fish Paste Rice Roll\n","\n","\n","There was a lot of fresh fish paste wrapped with fried bean curd then wrapped with rice roll. Very flavourful (not fishy) and has a lot of texture.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Coconut Steamed Milk Pudding Buns \n","\n","\n","Excuse the translation, but I think pudding sounds a lot nicer than \"runny\" or \"liquidizing\" buns. What these are are simply buns with a liquidy center made from duck egg yolk and shredded coconut. Usually I'm not a big fan of steamed buns but these ones has a lot of filling and it is very rich! I still prefer the ones at Sea Harbour and Jade.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","Deep Fried Taro Dumpling\n","\n","Mashed taro warm center lightly deep fried with a flaky exterior. One of my favourites.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","BBQ Duck with rice noodle.\n","\n","\n"," \n","Usually the duck is a deeper red compared to the one in the picture. My guess it wasn`t made fresh from the morning... The meat was a bit tough. But on any other day, it is usually really tasty, with crispy skin and tender meat (see below).\n"," \n"," \n","Hand Shredded Chicken\n","\n","Hand shredded chicken and jelly fish served with pickled carrots and radish. Cold appetizer with fragrant seasoned oil. The ratio of chicken and jelly to carrots and radish was a little low.\n","\n","Watch for their daily special.\n","Now, if you are a fan like I am, you will be sure to come try their dinner menu. They have a lot of specialty dishes like Dungeness Crab with Wild Rice Sea Conpoy & Chicken, Pigeon, King Crab and other seafood items...\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","King Crab Steamed\n","\n","Now you may be used to eating King Crab served with the legs dissected and shell ripped open... But have you tried to steamed the legs as a whole? Bet you don't see this often! This retains all the juice and the flavor. Most restaurants do not prefer to serve it this way simply because it is a lot of work and space. Ask and it can be done... But note... you will have to do the dirty work yourself - cutting and cracking the shells!\n","\n","The knuckles you can stir fry with soy sauce and scallions.\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","BBQ Duck\n","\n","Now like I mentioned previously, if it is freshly made it should boast a deep red color. Skin is crispy but the meat should be tender, juicy and never tough!\n"," \n"," \n"," \n","BBQ Pigeon\n","\n","Another delicacy and absolutely tender and moist.\n","Got to try the new Midam which has only been open for about two weeks. The service is still a little awkward/slow and I think they are still adjusting to the Chinese clientele compared to that of the North Rd. location. It seemed like they had the appropriate number of staff but the service was still generally slow and several tables were left unbussed for more than  -  minutes which made the wait for a table longer than necessary. \n","After we ordered we were expecting to be served some banchan but we had to ask and only potato was offered, no kimchi, etc. \n","We tried several dishes, starting with the bulgogi bibimbap ($ ). I would say that they don't put a lot of ingredients in this and felt that they should've just brought out the spicy/hot sauce along with the bibimbap. The server asked if we wanted any and proceeded to take it from the table next to us which felt a little awkward. Overall taste was good but a little pricey for what it is. \n","In my opinion, the servers should have also brought out extra cutlery for mixing the bibimbap and because this dish would be shared. \n","We also tried their spicy chicken with cheese ($ ) which is exactly what is described. Very enjoyable and juicy. The rice cake(?) that it's served with is also very nice and the portion is fair for $ . \n","For dessert we had the green tea sizzling toast which I thoroughly enjoyed. The mix of tastes and textures with the mochi, ice cream, and toast really work with this dessert. It might be nice if the toast were a bit crispier but overall it was great. \n","\n","As a disclaimer, we also ordered the Budae hotpot ($ ) which we really did not enjoy. The presentation was poor (raw instant noodles and a slice of processed cheese) but more importantly the taste and ingredients were not worth the nearly $  price tag. This is essentially a big pot of instant noodles you might make at home with some premade soup base and stuff you pull out of the freezer/pantry. Worst of all it was way too salty.\n","That being said, we brought this to the attention of the manager who offered to take it off our bill and comp'ed our dessert as well. He told us that normally they would add more vegetable broth after the pot had been sitting for a while so it doesn't get overwhelmingly salty but they were not on top of it in this case. \n","\n","I appreciate the manager taking ownership of the situation in this case and understand that it's difficult opening a new restaurant and things don't always run smoothly. While the Budae hotpot was truly awful, the other menu items were all pretty solid and worthy of a  / . If the service remains just as awkward and slow another month down the road this place would be closer to a  . /  in my books.\n","Lido Restaurant was another restaurant listed as a must stop in a Western publication and I was skeptical as the noted item was the humble pineapple bun.  \n","\n","But when I saw that Lido Restaurant was located in the busy Center Mall near Parker Place and in the Golden Village and had lines out the door, I become more interested.  \n","\n","As I was waiting in the lines (I went twice and it's the only place I went twice on this trip if that says anything), I would see people order pineapple buns by the masses.  How can something so simple, without any fruit (it's named for the appearance of it's texture), be that good????\n","\n","Finally, we were seated and the booth seating leads to some semblance of peace from the chaos of waiting by the door.  The servers take their time and don't rush you at all with your order, though they bring items very quickly and are very quick to take orders.  \n","\n","Our first pineapple bun arrived and I noticed it didn't have a slice of butter.  We made sure that it came back with the slice of butter that we had been told was key.  Then the first bite and I clearly understood.  The warm, sweet, fresh pineapple bun engulfed the cold, salty slice of cold butter and the entire contents mixed together as you chewed and swallowed.  It's a great combination of contrasts and wonderful flavors with nothing being too sweet or too salty.  A couple of blinks later and the pineapple bun was gone.  We ordered two more.  \n","\n","The rest of the menu is an expansive mix of Western cafe style dishes and Chinese classic soups, rices, and noodles.  There's a variety of set meal pairings you can choose from and many include included coffee or milk tea drinks or an upgrade to the beverage of your choice.  You also get included dinner rolls or can upgrade to that pineapple bun and some even include soup choices.\n","\n","Needless to say, I sampled a broad variety of items.  Everything hit the spot, even though the pineapple buns ARE the star of the show.  A sample of our orders:\n","\n","Curry Beef Brisket and Japanese Teriyaki Beef Tongue Set Meal - served with a Russian borscht soup that was hot and reminded me of my childhood both from the familiar flavor and the delicious vegetables.  The curry beef brisket was fantastic as the beef brisket was so tender and the curry sauce was so strong and flavorful.  It would have been perfect over rice except that I had upgraded to a pineapple bun for my starch.  Mmmmm, pineapple bun.  The beef tongue was tender and well done too.  Teriyaki sauce was mild and not overwhelming.\n","\n","Baked Spaghetti - plentiful cheese and baked in an oven until piping hot.  Rich, flavorful, and satisfying.\n","\n","Pork Blood Porridge - more a comfort breakfast food, the congee here is solid.  Perhaps not as spectacular as Tsim Chai Noodle but hits the spot.  \n","\n","Overall, we had a great two meals at Lido Restaurant.  Lido even has fantastic business hours of  :  AM to   midnight.  Plus they never run out of Pineapple buns unlike other places that run out of their most popular item by noon.  \n","\n","Lido is cash only.\n","Disclaimer: My girlfriend got invited to their media event and brought me as her plus one, so all our food was comped. I've been to Afuri in Tokyo so I was looking forward to this opening for months, especially after my most recent trip in November. \n","\n","First impressions - the space is huge with high ceilings, bright lighting, and a beautifully designed open kitchen and bar. There are lots of communal tables and seating, so hopefully they'll be able to accommodate the inevitable lines I anticipate. Ordering is done via touchscreen kiosks that accept all card payments, or you can bring your printout to the register to pay with cash. Pretty straightforward way to customize your toppings as desired. \n","\n","This evening, we were given a wide variety of appies between the two of us, including their Pork Belly bao, Soft Shell Crab bao, Gyoza, and Chicken Karaage. We were allowed to select our own ramen and wanting to taste a variety of their offerings, we went with the Yuzu Ratan ramen (spicy broth with thin noodles), Yuzu Tsuyu tsukemen (cold thick noodles), and Tantanmen (thick noodles in hot broth). \n","\n","Out of all the appies, I'd probably say I liked the Gyoza or Chicken Karaage the best. The Gyoza had a beautifully crisp skin and bottoms, but I did find the filling a bit too lean. A higher fat percentage would probably make it better combined and yield a better texture. The Karaage on the other hand had a really nice battered exterior, but I have to say, I really disliked the yuzu mayo egg salad they served as the condiment on the side. My girlfriend and I honestly didn't even know what it was until we went back and revisited the menu. Sometimes, simple is best. I would have been pretty happy with a classic kewpie mayo and some togarashi spice, or even a yuzu kosho if they wanted to get creative. In regards to the two baos, the Pork Belly was decently tasty. The fat slab of belly came with traditional hoisin type flavours so it was pretty non-offensive. I personally thought the Soft Shell Crab bao was the worst thing I ate all evening. There was an overwhelming butter flavour, and the combination of the kimchi with the spicy mayo and crab made the appy way too salty. The only saving grace was the cucumber, which lightened up the whole ordeal. \n","\n","Onto the ramen! In order of preference, we both liked the Tantanmen the best, then the Tsukemen, and the Yuzu Ratan. The thick noodles here are our choice as they retain a nice al dente bounce, and they got coated really nicely in the thick tan tan broth. I really loved the light tart flavours in the Tsukemen, and I would definitely order this in the summertime! The frisee lent a slight bitterness that meshed well with the fatty pork and I really enjoyed the overall dish. The Yuzu Ratan wasn't bad, just we preferred the other two more. It also wasn't nearly spicy enough for either of us, but my girlfriend is a self-proclaimed spice fiend so keep that in mind.\n","\n","All in all, Afuri offers a solid bowl of ramen, but at its high price point, it definitely won't be a regular occurrence for me. Our three bowls with all the topping add-ons would've been $  (!!!) if we had come of our own accord, which seems really steep to me. But if you're looking for a more upscale experience, planning on having a few cocktails and maybe treating a date, Afuri is a great option.\n","On the most important day of our lives, my husband and I decided to entrust Sea Harbour Seafood Restaurant with our traditional banquet dinner. We were thrilled by the fact that they had the date available, and secondly that the decor was a lot better than that of most Chinese Restaurants. So you can imagine my disappointment when this Restaurant failed to deliver on what was promised for our wedding day.\n","\n","Management - Shirley is the Manager there and we dealt with her on several occasions in person and on the phone. Let me tell you she is so busy that it is very difficult to get a straight answer via phone call. We had to go have dim sum, and see her in person to get our questions answered. The part that ticked me off the most was the fact that she was reluctant to write anything down on paper on a proper contract. She would verbally tell us the policies and agree to our schedules, and write it down in her book but would not outline it to us in a contract. She promised, as part of the gratuity (mandatory  %) that we would get a server for our bar. On the wedding day during cocktail hour which started at  , there was no one to be found, and the restaurant turned our guests away and told them to come back later. Finally when I demanded a server for our bar, they set up a table where guests had to pour the drinks themselves. Even when I complained, they still demanded that the  % gratuity had to be paid even though they didn't serve our guests. Secondly, for payment, I told them I did not want to carry so much cash with me on the wedding day. I asked if I could pay her   percent before, and pay the rest on the wedding day. She said I can pay after (up to one week after), so I agreed. On the day of the wedding she demanded payment and OBVIOUSLY I did not have the cash ready on hand so she spend over an hour arguing with my mom and my husband in the back room. This was the most unpleasant experience because she refused to write it down, and she went back on her word. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU THE STIPULATIONS IN WRITING!!!!!!!\n","\n","\n","Food - Traditionally there is a tasting involved but not at this restaurant. If you want to try the food for your wedding dinner, you will probably have to pay the $ -  bill for them to replicate the food. In saying that, we couldn't try it our selves as we did not have   people to come eat with us. On the day of the wedding, the food portions were much smaller than expected. I would give it a pass at  /  but the dim sum is MUCH better than the dinner.\n","\n"," \n","Service - Service was not the best as waiters rushed and I had heard it took a long time to get even water to the table. Secondly when my decorators were setting up the room, they were difficult and did not let them move tables or execute as we had discussed. Due to this, I had a much smaller dance floor than expected. Just an FYI, the management will tell you that the main room fits   tables easily with a head table and dance floor. THIS IS WRONG. I had   tables and a dance floor and a head table, and it was very very tight. I had to sacrifice the dance floor due to this misinformation.\n","\n","\n","FINAL VERDICT - There are better places to have your wedding with more modern decor. If I had to do it over again, I would have rather done Empire Seafood Restaurant down the street. Trust me, due to this terrible experience, I will never be giving my patronage to this restaurant again.\n","This night market makes most of the food festivals in the U.S look pretty SAD...

Not anymore!! We received terrible and condescending customer service which I will write below. I would not be posting this if they had APOLOGIZED properly, but they did not.\n","\n","It started off well at first. A young Chinese boy greeted my husband and I in a friendly way. We both wanted mango teas, but he said they were out and that the mango teas wouldn't arrive until May. That's all right, he was smiling and so polite. So we changed our order to Oolong Latte with small white pearls, and a Coffee Jelly Pu-erh Milk Tea. Here's where the trouble begins:\n","\n","- He didn't understand my Yelp check-in free coupon and asked one of the girl staff about it. That's ok, he's probably new and training. But when my husband ordered the Coffee Jelly Pu-erh Milk Tea, the boy repeated back, \"Coffee Jelly Milk Tea\". I said again, \"Pu-Erh, Pu-erh milk tea\", now feeling a bit uncomfortable that he didn't understand English. (We don't speak Chinese, so I repeated to make sure he understood). \n","\n","- A hint that I know that he must have been sleepy or tired was when he read out our bill as \"$ . \" but the bill was really $  something. So again, this worried me that he wasn't paying attention to his work. \n","\n","-After we got our bill, I noticed the bill looked weird. There was a $ .  extra charge. Now, I don't care about the money. I was concerned he got the order wrong. When we brought this up to the boy and the   girls working there, they started arguing back about the $ . . I told them we don't care about that, I just want the right order. We got a coffee jelly Milk tea, but we wanted the coffee jelly Pu-erh tea. They offered to give the   cents back, they were obviously not listening, or were too lazy to make a new one because there was a line up behind us. So what if there is a line up? They should treat all customers equal. \n","\n","- A Mandarin girl customer was listening and spoke up for me in Chinese, \"They want the Coffee Jelly Pu-Erh Tea, it's different than what you gave them\". I told her thank you for explaining. The girl staff then asked the boy staff why he made our drink wrong, and he lies, \"I already told them Pu-Erh is sold out.\" No he didn't!! I immediately said he told us the mango teas were out, he never told us the Pu-Erh was out. Then the girl staff tried to treat us like stupid again, saying there's no coffee for our original order. Of course we know that, I have no idea why she wants to keep arguing. In all the time they wanted to discuss against us, they could have just made us the right tea.\n","\n","- The   girl staffs began to treat us we were stupid again, and said this black milk tea is the same base and similar to the Pu-erh tea we originally wanted, and that we should accept it. I corrected them that it is not the same teas, and that I know my teas. I worked in the tea industry and my grandparents owned a tea store in Asia, so Shiny Tea staff's trick did not work on me. They just assume because we speak English, that we would know nothing about teas. Very arrogant for them to think that way. They also tried to treat us like it was about the   cents, how dumb since our original order would be   cents more. We don't care about the money, I work for a Law office as a Paralegal Assistant (and studying part-time to become a Lawyer). I do NOT care about the cents. I care about getting the right order and getting good customer service. We just want the RIGHT ORDER because I'm all about what is fair. \n","\n","-In the end, after I stood firm and refused to leave, they finally made the right order. How interesting that they made it when the boy lied that they were out of Pu-Erh (so now he told   lies). Never lie and argue to a lawyer, I will know and observe what people say very carefully.\n","\n","- They also did not give us a stamp card. This place advertises Buy   Get   Free. They owe me a stamp card with   stamps.\n","\n","I will be sending this review to management. If they don't respond, this story will go on my Facebook, Twitter, and blog, and I will get a friend to translate it into Chinese writing too.\n","\n","My main complaint is: Don't argue with your customer when you are wrong and don't try to act smart. Also, the boy should have apologized. He did not. He just put on a grumpy face. The girl apologized, but she said it without sincerity.\n","I did not intend on this day to come here, let alone come here at all except the place I wanted to go to was closed and I remembered while donating blood the girl who was donating her time told me if you want good Hainanese chicken, come to this place. Keeping that in mind and being denied going to another place, due to the fact they were closed on Monday, I came here with my mom. Around   on a holiday Monday, it's dead, like maybe one table, and that table had only one person sitting by themselves eating, should I enter, well it's a time where many Asian restaurants during this time are closed for the break and since I never came here might as well give it a shot.\n","\n","It's a clean, small place, that when empty is very roomy, there is a small (think under  ') flat screen playing some Chinese program while the person working there is really staying in the back and playing with her iPhone waiting for you to order. We received our menu and decided to call along another friend to come by, and at that moment our first order was the Laksa. My mom had to walk up from where we were sitting to find the person behind the till to put the order in...and in Cantonese she tells the chef in the back of the order. We eventually receive this huge bowl of Laksa, a nice creamy murky soup base that you can see the redness, and through this, the creamy coconut milk used to make this liquid. On top, floating with the help of a lot of vermicelli... some nice sized prawns, thinly sliced fish cake, shredded chicken, bean sprouts, a cut in half hard boiled egg, this thing had it all in presentation, but how was it? I was actually very happy with this bowl, as this was supposed to be a snack, became a full on meal, sharing with my mom, having each lovely bite, with enough of everything, from soup to noodles to protein, however you wanted to eat this, there was a lot where nothing was overpowering with great mix where is wasn't overly 'coconutty' but my kind of noodles on this sunny day. Eventually the third wheel came, and we decided to get more food.\n","\n","We ordered the Hainanese chicken with their flavored/scented rice, and I remember a lady coming in not too long ago while I was slurping down the noodles asking about her take out and if the rice was 'chicken' rice... in Cantonese... meaning flavored. We ordered an order that looked like half a bird with two bowls of rice, and a bowl of their curry beef with housemade roti, we did not know what to expect but if it was like the laksa that was just devoured prior to this order, we should be ok. Now coming up to past   the other thing I noticed was that there was more people in the place, and I forgot to mention, this was a cash only joint, and in this plaza where this place is.. there are a ton of restaurants, so no lack of choice. Our food eventually came and the first thing that wowed me was the golden, yellow color of the chicken rice, most places, it just glistens with whatever chicken fat that has been greased into the rice, this was a pleasant sight, and while it came out with the chicken it was all piping hot, steam coming from the rice, the chicken.. all of it. Taking each bite of the chicken, it was moist, juicy, tender, and tasty, mixed with the rice it was a perfect deadly over-eating combo.\n","\n","The curry beef was another surprise, full of flavor, different from that of other nationality curries, I wasn't too fond of the gooey texture of the roti, but to each their own, and to making that it wasn't bad, it just wasn't to my liking. We had to pack most of this home, as it was just too much for three people, forget midday snack, this was dinner and we were done. I did end up eating a portion of the leftovers on another night and they were as tasty as they were when eating right at the restaurant. While coming out after paying for the bill, the place was packed, so people know about this place and they come to it.. just like that tip I got from donating blood, this place is good.. and it's cheap for what you get. I'll be back, and hope that it pleasantly surprises me like the first time I am here.\n","If you are looking for pretentious gourmet food in a classy cafe, you will be sorely disappointed - but if you want to know what it is like to eat home cooked Malaysian-style foods at affordable prices in the back of someone's kitchen - then you are in for a real treat! (^__^)\n","\n","*Prata or Roti () Prata is an unleavened flat bread derived from the Indian/Punjabi/Bengali regions, well known from the Netherlands to South Africa, and from the West Indies to SE Asia, but I find it more similar to the Chinese/ Korean/ Japanese \"green onion pancake\" (/ /). At any rate it is a delicious side with anything you might order at Prata Man.\n","\n","*Hainanese chicken ()  - a Chinese classic () with a Malaysian twist also popular in Thailand () , often considered the national dish of Singapore. Prata Man does an awesome version: if you eat in it is served cold along with acar (carrot and daikon pickles), sweet chilli and green onion/ ginger condiments; warm \"oiled\" rice and hot clear gingery-chicken broth. If you get take away, you miss out on the broth. For our family of four we devour a whole order easily, and often add satays or Rendang curry, prata Rendang and extra acar. When there is just two of us, we only order half but often share with it, especially if it is cold outside. In the summer heat we like to order two whole orders to take home and have with a cold vegetable and noodle salad. We have been eating this dish here for about ten years and have never had it boneless - so I think you might need to request that with your order if you prefer it that way, as many have told me they have had it that way here - or maybe it only makes a difference if you order in English instead of Cantonese?\n","\n","*Beef, Chicken or Pork Satays;traditional SE Asian street food of marinated meat barbecued on skewers () and served with a crushed peanut sauce. Simple and tasty. We usually add  -  to our whole order of Hainanese chicken if there are  -  of us eating, but they take longer to prepare so we usually get them half-way through our meal, just in time to stop the young people from complaining they are still hungry.\n","\n","*Rendang Beef Curry: may actually resemble Hong Kong-style Beef Curry () more than anything like the Indonesian dish that it is named after, but we enjoy it. It is a mild beef and potatoes curry with lots fo gravy. It is just enough for one person, or two if shared and accompanied with prata &/or rice.\n","\n","*Mee Goreng: another Indonesian inspired dish cooked Malay-stye derived from Chinese chow mein (), with thick noodles stir-fried with tofu and pork (unlike in Malaysia). It is a big dish, just right for two with a bowl of soup, unless you are young and have a hollow leg, then it might be just enough for your lunch.\n","\n","*Nasi Goreng: fried rice () Indonesian style. A great filler to have with soup, curry or the Hainanese chicken especially if you don't like the \"oiled\" rice or would like to have something different. We usually have it for \"brunch\" with soup.\n","\n","* Laksa: a coconut-based curry noodle soup () that is uniquely SE Asian. The Prata Man version has vegetables, tofu puffs, and seafood. This is great for lunch and suitable for one, or to share with some other side dishes. Perfect for a cold, wet, blustery, winter day.\n","\n","*Barley tea: Served cold or hot. This is quite nice hot in the winter, and a nice change from the jasmin or green teas we usually have with Asian food when we eat out. The cold version is quite sweet but we enjoy it in the summer as a nice balance with the spicy and salty foods we usually eat.\n","\n","I think they cater to the tastes of the Hong Kong Chinese who make up the majority of their client base and who generally do not eat \"in\" the restaurant. So they may not necessarily be \"authentic\" Singaporean cuisine, but it is very popular in Richmond and very inexpensive.\n","\n","There is usually enough free parking, but you need to go prepared to pay cash for your order, whether you eat in or take out.\n","\n","***Very busy in the evenings and on weekends - but they have a great combo deals for lunch during the week - a great opportunity to bring a friend and try something new ***\n","I came back for lunch, as this is my second going with this place, waking up, feeling empty, being almost  , I could have starved all the way to dinner, but since I was in Richmond I had memories of some excellent claypot rice here so I allowed my stomach to guide me to my choice. Empire Centre, your not coming here just to walk around, you have a purpose, and one of those is the food court, and 'James Snacks' is one of those destination spots that many come to.\n","\n","There is not much english at this stall, so you better know what your ordering, and just be 'patient', as this stuff doesn't just come out of the kitchen. A wait time of about   minutes before you get to carry that hot pot to your table before you devour is in order. This time I ordered the 'meatcake' with sausage and the wait to eat began. For those of you who don't want to eat, a word of advice, call in, order, and get here in   minutes, if timed right, this should be perfect.\n","\n","When I saw my pot coming out to the front counter, I quickly walked over to identify myself and walk away with my food. The pot is covered, and on the side is a dish of soy sauce for you to pour in and allow it to bake some more to get a mix of salty saucy goodness. When I opened the pot, a puff of steam rised and I was welcomed to a sight of greens piled in the center. Along the sides were nicely cut up Chinese sausage pieces, and right in the middle was 'meatcake'. This thing was almost the entire top surface of the pot, hiding the bright white rice lying below. Seeing all this food in it's glory I poured in the side of soy sauce and closed the lid.\n","\n","I enjoyed everything about my meal, but something wasn't there, maybe it was the 'meatcake' that didn't wow me like the first time, maybe it was the combination of the meats. I felt that it wasn't as hot out of the pot as when I had it last time, and also elsewhere. The meat was a little over dominant to the portions of the pot, it was thick, and very hard to break apart, with the thinly plastic spoon, and hard to snap apart with the chopsticks. They have to really think about replacing their spoons, cause it does bring down the experience as you are fighting with trying to peg off the crispy bits off the pot with this flimsy utensil and your not going to carry a metal spoon everywhere you go.\n","\n","If you want to take it to go.... you would think why the hell would you want to, but here's the catch, you can, and with the pot. Tacked on is a $  deposit fee to take the claypot home or to the office with you and when you decide to bring it back you'll get your $ , still word to the wise it to eat this thing hot off the fire. I will be back, and hopefully the pot of rice I pick that day will wow me like the first time but this is still a solid pick for your claypot (or sandpot as they call it here) bowl of rice! If you can, bring your own spoon, and just like everyone else who has eaten this thing, most people don't even leave a piece of the rice remaining on the bottom of the pot... that says a lot.\n","A new Gem in richmond.  I found my new regular dining diner!!  Saw many   star reviews and saw   star review. \n","Decided to try it out. I m a bit detailed so please read on for my review.\n","\n","There are only   tables, family owned business.  The restaurants was busy with the guest at the table and many take out orders.  We waited for   mins, and the guest were very kind to ask for the bill after dinner seeing people waiting.\n","\n","The environment is very welcoming with cute sushi on the walls.\n","\n","When we sat down, we were given tea right away.  The Tea wasn't too hot, for it is a hot summer day now.  Just the right temperature to heat up the mouth and get ready for dinner.\n","\n","The nigiri sushi price on the menu is great. Haven't seen $ .  piece in ages. I wondered how good were the sushi?  \n","\n","To my surprise, the sushi was great. (See pictures that I post.) \n","\n","We ordered a lot of food and only worked out to be $  per person. You can spend that at an all you can eat but the quality was way better then expected.\n","\n","It was very busy so if you asked me, service is good enough to give   star since only one server. \n","\n","I had doubts with this place when I saw a   star and the rest   stars. (Probably friends helping out) but hey, I don't think it deserved the   star rating because it was busy.  I owned a dessert house in Vancouver and understand long working hours by myself serving guest and may have missed orders from time to time but the food is super duper awesome.\n","\n","Anyways, the salmon sashimi was very fresh, the magic roll was very refreshing for summer, miso soup didn't taste like regular ones u get from Richmond sushi type.  Every roll, nigiri sushi pieces were big enough and just right.  With the sushi rice have just the right rice vinegar amount. Brings out the correct sweetness without any sour taste like samurai or banzai sushi. I can tell the shop is using very nice quality Japanese vinegar like kiyo and hapa.  The rice was sticky enough to taste the rice texture piece by piece.  Something that you need to determine from good sushi chef cooking the sushi rice.\n","\n","The plates are used mostly black slate, making it taking pictures of sushi much more contrast.  Pictures are better than words, so please check out my photos.\n","\n","The choice of soya sauce was not too sweet nor too salty.  Just good enough to bring the flavor of the fresh raw fish.\n","\n","The Uni, ikura and topiko was awesome and fresh.  There was even a sushi with all three combined!!! \n","\n","The Udon we had, the soup base was very tasty and flavorful. \n","\n","We were very full when we finished.  I would of given it a   to   star because of the seating but felt it deserved a   star due to food quality and didn't think the   star rating was justifiednwih just ordering one simple roll and waiting for that long for the meal and the table.  Everyonr can tell this restaurant put a lot of time and effort into the food quality, the renovations and choice of plates serving with the sushi so people can let the camera eats first.  It may not be a grand grand sushi shop, but hey look at the awesome price and outstanding food quality!! \n","\n","Many places in Japan that have good food are small, hidden and line up. \n","\n","I can tell, I will come back again and again for their nigiri!  I urge everyone to try and if you feel my review is good enough to get you coming. Give some likes and out your honest review.\n","\n","Feedback to the owners, it must be very tiring to open   days a week.  Hope your business keep doing well and take a well deserved break!! Up!!\n","You know I seem to be writing a lot of   star reviews.  It's mostly because the reviews I write, I tend to know a bit about the place before hand.  Usually by recommendations, and or just know that it would be a place I would like.\n","Ember Indian Kitchen is one of them.  It opened up in   and I found out about it before it opened from my occasional drives along the old Dyke road.\n","\n","\"Hey!\" I say to self.  \"There is a new Indian restaurant opening!!\"\n","Sadly months went past and I ended up reading reviews of this place before I got to try it out. I wanted to be FTR (first to review) this place but things just didn't work my way.  While I passed this place and reviewed other places, I just pushed Ember Indian Kitchen aside like I knew the time wasn't quite right for me to come and eat there.\n","\n","Well, it's been a few weeks since coming here and now I get to write my review of this place.\n","\n","Firstly. Okra fries. FABULOUS!  Not everyone loves Okra, but I do.\n","I have wet dreams about that veggie.  The deep fried crispy hardness on the outside and the gelatinous slimy film that coats the seeds inside.  When you have tried it you might think the same way I do about this veggie that was made so famous in Gumbo and Asian cuisines.  It truly is an erotic food item that I would consider an appreciated taste.  The Okra fries level the playing field for those who might not like Okra, but will like how the chefs at Ember Indian Kitchen does it.\n","\n","Unfortunately because of that dish, everything else kinda was just eaten with a lot of \"mmmmmm\" and \"gooood\"  and \"yeah, I like this too\".   Very delicious but not quite my first impression of \"OMG I'm going to..............\n","....Tweet about this!\"\n","YELP!!\n","\n","Another good sign this is an excellent place to get good Indian and African style food is that there are lots of local people dining here.  We bumped into friends who dine here and they are trendy girls.\n","Yes, this is a chick friendly, :\"Instagrammy\", #girlsnightout place.  Ember takes the Traditional Indian dishes and takes it to a modern high.  The bonus is it's location.  It has a great view of the river and it's peaceful and on a summers night, you can have a romantic stroll after dinner.\n","You want to dress nice for this.\n","\n","Note: it does get a bit loud when it's busy.  There is a huge echo present where all the conversations mix with he music and the kitchen noises.  The ambiant presence is similar to those modern restaurants you would find downtown.  Full of buzz and vibrancy.\n","If you happen to come at a time when it's a bit quieter, the experience can be quite different.  All in all, make sure you bring a friend or friends that would love food the way you like and that commonality will just make this experience that much more better.  How often do you you get to dress up for Indian food outside of VJ's orbit?\n","\n","Sorry for the typo's. If there are any, and there are I am sure.  Then typo's written free of charge and tax not included.\n","I've been to Moxie's twice now. The first time, I was pleasantly surprised because I was there on their wing night, which is quite a value. They have a variety of flavors to choose from like Buffalo Wild Wings. The wings were juicy, but the sauces were all kind of on the sweet side. Teriyaki and honey garlic were almost indistinguishable. The dining room and bar was nicely decorated. Service was polite and prompt, although I was perplexed by being served a StrongBow over ice with a straw and a lime in it. No biggie though. \n","\n","The second time I ordered pot stickers and the teriyaki beef bowl. This was after I was passed from different server to different server to place a to-go order. I was pleased that they offered a   percent discount for my company. Once my order was taken, the woman helping me was very pleasant. But, it would have been nice to been offered a seat at the bar while I waited, or a glass of water or something. I just stood there awkwardly in my rain-soaked coat waiting an excessive amount of time in their hallway since there were no chairs. Everyone kept thinking I was in line for the bathroom or something. \n","\n","Now onto the real reason for the two star review, everything I ate was worse quality than Panda Express. How can a city with such a huge Asian population get away with serving pot stickers and a teriyaki dish that inedible? The other perplexing thing is that they serve teriyaki-flavored wings, but the sauce on my teriyaki beef bowl was definitely not a teriyaki I recognized. It tasted like that horrible canned fake La Choy Chinese food families in middle America served in the  . And it was just as salty too! The beef, which they upcharged me for, was tough and gray. It looked like the undesirable cuts for a stew that would cook over a long period of time. The potstickers were no better. These were definitely the frozen Costco variety. I know they tasted familiar and there's a Costco up the street. Hmmm? Anyway, they also gave me two sauces with it. One was a vaguely soy-chili sauce. The other? Some kind of sweet salsa. That was just weird. \n","\n","Overall, totally underwhelmed by the experience. It's too bad too because I stay here often for work. They could have had a regular. The other reviewer was right. It's totally on par with TGI FRIDAYS or Applebee's except it's pricier. For over $ , I definitely got a meal that was less tasty than mall or airport Chinese/Japanese. I really don't get how they could mess up something so simple as teriyaki beef! Maybe I just ordered wrong, but I don't care to try this place again to find out. When I got back to my room, my stomach became upset an hour or two after eating here. I definitely had to run to the restroom a couple of times if you know what I mean. Never again. Sorry, Moxies. I won't be back.\n","We came for the lunch specials. At around   on a Wednesday, it wasn't busy at all. Especially compared to the dinner times I've passed by. We went in through the mall side, not sure if there's a different entrance but it did take some time before we were acknowledged. Our server was really nice but seems to be running around quite a lot so it was a bit difficult at times to get her attention. So... it looks like you cannot mix the two lunch combo's (Set RA and SU). We decided on the SU. \n","\n","Things we got were:\n","\n","-Daily Congee ( / ): Very soft and pillowy. I like that it's subtle in taste to give us a break for all the spiciness and flavourful dishes that comes with the meal.\n","\n","-Green salad ( / ): Simple iceberg lettuce salad with some oranges and raddish. \n","\n","-Spicy squid salad ( / ): Not as spicy as it looks. Not sure if it'd call it a salad. It's not really cold but there are veggies with it. The squid was nice and not chewy.\n","\n","-Mung Bean Jelly ( / ): Didn't have too much of this but looks like jelly fish and has the texture of jelly like the name calls it. I wouldn't have guessed that it's made from mung beans though, especially with it's near translucent color. \n","\n","-Bulgogi ( / ): One of my favourite Korean dishes. We each got two pieces. Our   server helped up start the grilling process so we could continue eating while it cooked. Loved the fatty parts. So much flavour! Just yum!\n","\n","-Potato Pancake ( / ): We each got two pieces. The plate also came with some powder and a flower drawn with hot sauce and a bowl of vinegar (?). I didn't like that powder and the hot sauce was just ok. I enjoyed it most when it's dipped in vinegar. \n","\n","-Deep fried sweet & sour pork ( / ): There's too much batter and almost no sign of meat. I almost thought it was calamari from the color. \n","\n","-Grilled Atlantic Croaker ( / ): The fish tasted good but too many bones for my liking. \n","\n","-Herb Pork Belly ( / ): Each got two pieces. The pork belly didn't have much flavour on its own (my first piece) but along with the sauce it tasted good (  piece). Guess they could be more consistent in covering it with the sauce. Also some pieces were topped with tobiko but others didn't. The pickled veggie tasted good. I wonder what it is....\n","\n","-Soy Bean Paste soup ( / ): I'd like it more if it was a tad bit less spicy. But definitely good to have on a cold day. This is sure to keep you warm.\n","\n","-Korean Rice punch ( . / ): Interesting but I'm not sure what to make of it except that the pine nuts was a nice addition. \n","\n","-Side dishes ( / ): We got some beans, kimchi and the spicy potatoes. The potatoes were really good. They were super stingy with the beans. If someone used a spoon, they'd sweep up the entire dish for themselves. Kimchi is ...kimchi. Personally don't like it so I can't judge if it's good or not. \n","\n","Overall, it's a great deal for $ .\n","Very rarely do I receive bad customer service. I am thinking back and honestly can not remember when I got that angry/annoyed with staff, and wanted to speak with the manager.\n","\n","Needless to say I received very poor customer service here   times, and   when I wasn't even there...let me explain.\n","\n","Incident  * Girl   ( ) takes my order in a bitchy tone for no apparent reason. It goes on the screen for Girl   ( ) to make it. I go to the bathroom, the drink should be made by the time I come out, because this is what good coffee houses do! So   didn't even start making it. Then while I stand there in front of her, she starts. Then she uses  % milk, instead of what I designate, I had to tell her that it was wrong, because she didn't notice otherwise...then brushed it off like she knew. Then she uses the wrong tea bag because   didn't specify on the screen that I ordered that. Then after all of this, it's made shitty, but whatever I leave because I got my drink literally   minutes after I order. I can deal with this maybe on one occasion seemingly as   was new, but not anymore from the same person.\n","\n","Incident  * I come again, it's the same combo of   and   working. So I am not oblivious to peoples signals, like some may be. When I walked in   signaled to   with her hands, and her mouth saying like look that look it's that girl. And   gave   this look. How rude. Anyways I order the same drink,   wasn't being that bitchy today.   makes it, and tries to make small talk when I could care less. Then I taste it, and it didn't have enough vanilla. I bring this up to  , and she got so annoyed, like I am not asking you to solve a organic chem problem, am I? She almost grabs the cup out of my hand to put more vanilla in it, but seeming as its such a issue, I just leave. \n","\n","Incident  * Probably the worst experience out of the  , and I wasn't even there! So my sister goes in for me one day, and gets the same drink.   took the order, and then says to my sister (with a immense amount of attitude) as my sister was describing it, \"Are you sure you don't want it with soy milk.\" Then my sister tells  , \"What's with the attitude.\"   says, \"Well there is this girl, this girl who comes in everyday....no every other day to get the same drink.\" My sister says, \"You mean my sister,\" in a firm tone.   shouts her little fucking mouth. Seriously, what if I came in every single in the morning (which I don't) to get my drink for the train to uni, or like many people--for work. A lot of people at a lot of different establishments go in for the same beverage, and its their \"usual\"...and while those establishments remember your order and make it before you even order, here they obviously ridicule it. \n","\n","Also while   was making another drink prior to mine, my sister witnessed both of them talking about their plans for the weekend and the like, in a loud, obnoxious tone...this is something you should clearly do in front of customers eh! Also she witnessed something that shouldn't be tolerated at all.   was making a drink, and she used the wrong ingredients that the customer specified. When   gave the customer the drink, she said to   after, \"I don't think they'll notice.\" Uhmmmmm what if they're not like me, who don't ask after the drink is made if it has the right milk or whatever, and they put their trust in you, to make their drink correctly. What if they the customers had a life-threatening allergy, then what would happen you idiot, you would be liable. Seriously I was shocked. \n","\n","I don't go out of my way to make employees lives hell, but here it was needed. I got in contact with the manager and I told him everything that happened, he was very appreciative, and said action would be taken. A few weeks after being in contact with the manager, I saw new, much friendlier employees working. I still saw   working but not  , wonder what happened...\n","\n","Its quite interesting what people will do without authority because all of this happened without the manager prevalent.\n","Hello everyone, I am now officially onto my first food review for the year  . Whew, it definitely took a lot longer for me to be consistent with my uploading of my restaurant review. Life just happens to take priority in the past six months. Enough about me, today I have to share a restaurant food review and this time my significant other and I was craving for Korean cuisine Bibimbap and we were searching around on Yelp and Zomato for the top ten best Korean cuisine in Richmond, BC and we came across Cherry's Food House and the restaurant is on Alexandra Road which has numerous restaurants stemming for two to three blocks. Cherry's Food House is operated and owned by mainland Chinese descent. Their main theme of the restaurant is Yanji Korean & Classic Korean cuisine. \n","\n","Our first visit was on Jan  ,   for lunch. As we walked in we were greeted by a host/server and sat us down at a booth with their menus. We were then given some time to glanced over their menu and given tea and water right away. After a couple minutes, we decided to order their Seafood Tofu Pot as an soup appetizer to share with a bowl of steam rice and two orders of Beef Hot Stone Rice ( Bibimbap) as an entree. Our appetizer soup and small pickled dishes ( Banchan ) was served to us first then after about five minutes shortly after our main entree was then served to us sizzling hot. \n","\n","Overall, this visit was worth the leap of faith because the food arrived within a good time lapse since we ordered and the temperature and seasoning on point. My significant and myself vowed to come back for a second visit to this restaurant. \n","\n","Our second visit was just this past weekend on Mar  ,   for dinner. We made a reservation for two people this time as it was a weekend evening. As we walked in, we were greeted by a different host / server compare to our first visit. We were quickly seated at our table along with their menu. We were also served tea and water as well right after he gave us to glanced at their menu offerings. This time we decided to ordered a different appetizer to share Pork Bone Hot Pot Soup ( Small ) with a bowl of steam rice and again as an entree we ordered two orders of Beef Hot Stone Rice ( Bibimbap) as an entree because we love eating this dish a lot. As there was some time lapse between our ordering we were able to delve into their small pickled dishes ( Banchan ) right before we were served with their Pork Bone Hot Pot Soup. About another couple minutes, we were also served with our main entree. \n","\n","Overall, I rate this restaurant a  .  star out of   star, Reason being, as our Pork Bone Hot Pot Soup was boiling and to prevent overcooking I turned off the portable gas stove but I forgot to lift of the lever for gas but our host / server was able to notice and directly came over to our table and let us know it was still on. I feel embarrassed as I didn't turn the portable gas stove completely off. After a minute, our host/server was also able to come back to our table to top up our pork bone broth into our hot pot. I feel the service was very good and seasoning, quality control and temperature was on point. The only complain I have is they have their audio system turned on quite loud which means other customers with their party has to speak a bit louder which causes the ambiance of the restaurant to be very noisy. I definitely will come back for a third visit in the near future. Another thing came in my mind before closing out on the food review, I think they should have a website or a active Facebook or Instagram page to promote their restaurant as there was none to be found, only yelp reviews and trip advisor was to be found. \n","\n","Phone:  - - \n","\n","Address:   -   Alexandra Road\n","\n","Richmond, BC\n","\n","  4B3\n","So now that there is some traction here at Sanpoutei and the reviews are coming in.  I'd like to state a few things that come to mind after reading them.  Firstly everyone has their own taste and reasons for liking ramen.  Each is individual in what they like and think ramen should be. \n","\n","Today on my fourth visit I brought some specialists in ramen from Japan.\n","I also brought the \"Japanese Food Critique\" who is a culinary expert in the ways of Japanese food, it's history and culture. She can be pretty damn picky.\n","\n","While waiting in line for over an hour. Everyone was getting hungry. We were reading over the menu and the first thing two of them said was \"Niigata? Famous for Ramen?....where's the Gyoza?\"  \"This isn't a traditional ramen shop.  Too big and fancy\"  \"Is this a franchise? Are they really Japanese?\"\n","\n","When we seated, my favourite server came up and said hi and took our orders.  ( pssst, she's the cutest one there). \n","\n","Ordered up The Chicken Kaarage in both Oroshi(grated daikon radish topping, very traditional) and the Tartar sauce topping( popular in many Izakaya style places). \n","When I asked their opinion, they all said very good. Impressed considering most Kaarage served is NOT Kaarage in Canada.  Unfortunately I think many people who are conditioned to eating what they are told is Kaarage think this is too soggy or too saucy.  It's like how modern Japanese foodies in the western world think California rolls and other fancy sushi is real Japanese food.  Hey!! Don't be so stupid! What y'all think fortune cookies are real Chinese food too? \n","\n","My colleague from Japan had Sanpoutei's specialty ramen made from dried fish.  He was surprised at how closely it resembled Tokyo style ramen.  And he did concurs that he thinks most people wouldn't like the soup, as they are used to the modern fatty tonkotsu or chicken broths.  Most people who Yelp about Ramen probably never had original ramen.  Many would not like this slightly fishy broth. \n","However, after asking other Japanese people who tried this soup, they ALL concurred that this broth was indeed a  -  star rating! \n","Think about that.  Are you a ramen poser? \n","\n","His wife had the tsukemen which she really enjoyed.  Rating?   stars. \n","\n","Unfortunately the Japanese Food Critique did what she does most often and bashed her Maze ramen with a   star rating.   It didn't taste good to her. But she did have the Tsukemen before and gave that a high rating.\n","\n","They had various ratings of the ramen itself. \n","One said they prefer the Hokkaido (thick) style noodle and she said Sanpoutei's noodles were not thick enough for her. \n","The other two liked the noodles and appreciated that they were made fresh.\n","All agreed that the texture of the noodles were correct. \n","See Webpage on different types of ramen noodles  \n","\n","My guests all agreed that Sanpoutei should have Japanese fried rice, but this location doesn't have it.  It depends on each location it seems. \n","\n","This last visit I tried the \n","Bamboo shoot - ok for the price. Slightly spicy, low glycemic index value, but it has sugar in it.\n","Agedashi tofu - I have had better.   stars \n","Oden - sadly sold out...... Next time.\n","\n","Retried the following:\n","Kaarage's - still highly rated.  Hopefully you can appreciate it.  -  stars.  \n","\n","Fried Shrimp Salad (Ebi fry ) large size -gives you three prawns instead of two.\n","Not as good as before.  I had a number of greens that were not fresh ( I find that restaurants get lazy using this type of salad greens and  % never inspect them well enough before plating). The dressing was a bit messy like it was rushed.  That went down to a   star rating sadly. \n","\n","I tried a bit of the Maze Soba and something didn't taste right about it.  It was off.  It dropped from a   or   rating down to a   star.  What happened? \n","\n","Had a taste of the fish broth soup and definitely agree that it is a great soup!!! I will ask if I can order it without the ramen next time and substitute it with bean sprouts instead.  (This will be a Good test of their flexibility for customers with dietary challenges) Unfortunately most of you may not like this  broth as much.  If you do  try it please tell me if you liked it or not.  \n","\n","Especially the Maze ramen. Because now we have a hit and a miss in a big way. \n","\n","Overall census among the Japanese community that I have spoken to, the Tsukemen and the Fish broth are both hits. \n","\n","\n","Typos free of charge as I was all thumbs up typing this on the iPhone\n","You know what, I'm a bit disappointed. Not with the food - but with the service. \n","\n","We came in on a Friday night for my mom's   birthday and were a bit disappointed with how we were treated. We came in a bit earlier for our reservation and they were able to accommodate us, which was a great start. \n","\n","Once we were sat, it took about   minutes for someone to greet us or bring waters, even after we made eye contact with a few different waiters. Finally I reached out to a passing waiter and asked if we could have some water and he said \"oh, of course let me grab your server\" and I politely told him that we didn't know who our server was because they hadn't come by yet. \n","\n","Our server came by, apologized for keeping us waiting and took our drink orders. Sauvignon blanc for me, mojito for dad, mocktail for mom, and agua for my brother. We also ordered a few appetizers to start: baked brie board and calamari. Our server brought out the wrong wine for me, a red instead of a white. Wine is wine though and I'll happily drink any wine put in front of me, so I drank it anyway. \n","\n","On to our mains: my whole family got an assortment of steaks and since I don't eat red meat, I got the pistachio crusted salmon with a twice baked potato. Yum yum yum. One thing The Keg has always been consistent with is their food, and this experience was no different. \n","\n","We had told our server at the beginning of the dinner that it was my mom's birthday and usually they serve the Billy Miner Pie for birthdays. But after our server took our plates away, he immediately brought the check not even asking if we wanted dessert or offering the birthday treat. What made it awkward was that another table he was serving at the same time received their birthday Billy Miner Pie and they were singing happy birthday. My dad asked about the pie and our server responded in a very rude way, \"Oh well jeez, with everything else you ordered, I didn't think you'd still want it!\".... Um, what?  ) That's just rude to say.  ) I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and it's always common courtesy to ask. I was kind of taken aback by his answer and said no, we don't want it anymore. After we paid, our server didn't say a single word to us and even as we were leaving I said \"Goodbye\" to him and he just looked at me and didn't say anything back. \n","\n","Maybe we were unlucky and caught our server on a bad day. It was just unfortunate because what should've been a fun birthday dinner was dampened by poor customer service. I do love the Keg (again for their consistent food quality) but after this experience it makes me hesitant to go back to this location. I'll likely visit other locations in Vancouver where I know great customer service is guaranteed.\n","International Summer Night Market is the second most-visited night market in Canada, and in terms of execution, is miles ahead of the night markets in the US. This event exemplifies what a replica night market outside of Asia should be - an evening to go shopping for random and rare merchandise, to play carnival games at a relaxed pace, to watch performances from local artists, and to share a few small bites with friends.\n","\n","The merchandise to food vendor ratio was very close to  .  to  . In California, their night markets are misrepresented as \"street food festivals\" or \"food truck showcases\". Once people enter the night market, they make a beeline towards the food stalls and line up as if the food were free. Eating while walking in a crowd is one aspect of night-life, but the food court is not the only attraction of a night market. This is probably why the ISNM planners placed the merchandise booths by the entrance and the food stalls in the back. \n","\n","In the merchandise area, you can find all sorts of cell phone accessories, many creative and innovative Korean cell phone case designs shipped from Asia for reasonable prices (under $ ). Some vendors sell Line and Japanese dolls imported from Hong Kong. You can also shop for discounted socks, sandals, girly stationary, DVDs, jewelry, massage cushions, blankets, and even lingerie. The best part this night market is that you can bargain just the way you do at Asia's street markets.  \n","\n","Once you're finished shopping or \"window shopping\", the food court is around the corner. This section is smaller than the one at the Richmond Night Market, but most of the food vendors are similar. The food and drinks are overpriced in order to help cover the expensive vendor fee. If you come just for the food, you will be disappointed. After paying the $  entrance fee, you have to accept the night market as a concept of \"paying extra for the experience or ambiance\". \n","\n","Most popular items were the hurricane potatoes, BBQ squid, an Xinjiang-style lamb skewers. Most creative award goes to Ice Cane, which is ice cream wrapped in crunchy corn tortilla. Most generous hawker was the Singapore street-style beef jerky, who passed out unlimited samples.\n","\n","I ordered two desserts. One was the egg waffle ($ . ) which was not made by a Cantonese crew. Only original flavor was available. One aspect that I didn't like was after the egg waffle preparation, the server placed each piece next to a minifan for several minutes. Cooling the egg waffle helps create a crispy texture but leaving it on the cooling rack for too long will reduce its temperature too much! Egg waffles taste best seconds after they've been handed to you by the vendor but here, only after a couple minutes, the egg waffle lost its crisp shell texture.\n","\n","The other dessert that I sampled was black sesame tofu pudding. It is a mix of Cantonese black sesame soup and unsweetened tofu pudding. Both items were extremely bland, and when mixed together yielded no taste. The sesame soup was not even thick, it was more like a watery soup. You have to add ginger syrup to the tofu pudding for flavor. Would not recommend this for $ . .\n","\n","Despite having to pay $  entrance this year, I thought that it was well spent. I bought a stuffed animal that was only available overseas and sampled some Chinese desserts. The night market is a relaxing place to wander around once in a while on a summer weekend, when most shops have closed and you have nothing else planned for the rest of the evening.\n","\n","\n","Tip:\n","Come before   to find street parking. I parked on Vicscount Way and walked   minutes to the entrance. The shopping center on No.  Road x Bridgeport is also available for free parking. Otherwise, parking at the Home Depot lot costs $ .\n","When I was younger, my family and I would come for Sunday brunch buffet at the Pantry. I remember it being pretty full and having enjoyed the meal. Things have changed now.\n","\n","My husband and I visited the location for the Sunday brunch buffet recently because I remember having good memories there. When we walked in there was a large board with the buffet prices. For adults it's $ .  but you have to buy a drink (which is additional to the price) in order to qualify for the buffet. That turns the cost into $  or more which really gets you thinking if it's worth it.\n","\n","The hostess took us to our table but it was rather odd that she picked the booth farthest from the buffet and closest to the door. We asked to sit closer to the buffet and she guided us to the next booth. She seemed nice. At the booth, she asked us what drinks we wanted and I requested an orange juice and my husband requested a tea. It was surprising how long it took for us to get our drinks considering how simple they were to prepare, especially the orange juice! Later, I noticed that the girl was working alone on the floor. Even when there were more people at the restaurant she was jumping from host to server. Poor girl.\n","\n","The place was empty except for one family that had also chosen the buffet option. During the second half of our meal, more people started coming in. It wasn't as packed as it used to be but there were definitely more people to share the food with. I did notice that a lot of people opted out of the buffet and just ordered from the menu.\n","\n","The buffet itself was okay. They served the usual things such as scrambled eggs, sausages, hash browns, pancakes, waffles and such. They also had spaghetti, meatballs, mushrooms and eggs benny. Everything was fine except the eggs benny. They must have been sitting there for a while, definitely not fresh. They were there long enough for the bread (English muffin) to be soaked and it made it difficult to cut into pieces. They also had bread, croissants and mini muffins. We tried the croissants which were a bit dryer than they should be. The Caesar salad on the side was drenched in dressing and looked pretty soggy. The mini sandwiches beside it which I did try were yummy but also soggy. On the side they had desserts such as cakes, cookies and pudding. I liked the cakes but the pudding was not so great.\n","\n","Something that really surprised me was the bacon. First of all, there was no bacon. I didn't notice it for a while until someone who came in later was asking for it. The server brought a plate of bacon and placed it on the table. I took a few pieces for my husband and I to have since we had missed out. I was in shock when I found a huge piece of plastic (  x   roughly) in the bacon. What in the world. My guess is that they were in a hurry to make the bacon as the other person was insisting on it and they probably forgot a piece of the wrapper. I left the plastic wrapper on my plate hoping that the server would see it when she took my plate. I didn't say anything because I was just really surprised. I'm just glad I didn't choke on it.\n","\n","Something that was random but I thought I would include were the bathrooms. The restaurant is a large square shape and to get to the bathrooms you had to walk to the opposite corner from the entrance, then walk to the end of the hallway and finally go up the stairs. A pretty long distance but it's all right, at least you can burn something off on your way there and back. What was really unfortunate though is how COLD it was. Holy moly. As soon as I got to the second floor I was freezing. I am not joking you, this bathroom felt like I was about to pee outside. I feel bad if anyone had to touch the toilet seat with their bumbum. While I was freezing washing my hands another customer told me she too was freezing. Maybe a little heating upstairs wouldn't hurt.\n","\n","Overall, we found this buffet to be okay for the price. It's not the best, there are definitely better places out there. However, if you're looking for a buffet brunch (which there aren't many of in Richmond) then you can try this place out. Don't have high expectations though.\n","**This review is for their High Tea**\n","\n","When I think of Capstone, their yummy fondue usually comes to mind but seeing a SocialShopper deal, I decided to try out their High Tea option -   for the price of   deals are always a win, right? Wrong... I really don't like writing negative reviews but this one is necessary to warn others.\n","\n","I decided to go with my boyfriend, which was his first time having high tea. I made a reservation on a Friday afternoon @  , which was their opening time. Upon entering the restaurant, I could still see them setting up the area and kitchen area. There was already another group of   people in the restaurant as well.\n","\n","We were seated in a cute and nicely furnished area, only weird part was the random Polaroid photos of people/customers on the wall - reminded me of my highschool days of taking sticky piks! I digress... We told them we had a SocialShopper voucher, so the high tea menu was already set, we just needed to pick a drink. I ordered the hot Milk Black Tea and my boyfriend had a simple Green Tea. We got our drinks within   minutes, and surprisingly before the other people who were there before us. The milk tea was flavourful and creamy. My only frustration was that our drinks were not refillable - how could we enjoy a High Tea without more tea?! It was unfathomable, so we had to carefully sip and make our tea last the entire meal.\n","\n","Our server was really nice and polite. She explained that they were running a little behind because they had a no-show that morning. So they only had the   of them running the place, it wasn't too bad since there was only   tables to serve. However, they seemed to be quite disorganized and slow with their prep. We were sitting right in front of the prep area and I had the chance to see everything that went on during the   mins we waited for our food to be made and brought to us.\n","\n","First off, high tea is supposed to be a lovely arrangement of pretty sandwiches made of delectable ingredients, fresh, warm scones, flakey pasteries, and delicious sweets.\n","\n","The \"high tea\" at Capstone consisted of: Sandwiches made of one piece cold deli ham in between plain sliced bread with some mayo, frozen store-bought mini dried scones, hard pastries, and frozen store-bought chocolate treats. I think the only thing that tasted good from that platter were the fresh fruits. Everything was mediocre and I was really sad that I was basically paying to eat foods from a frozen box that was probably bought at a supermarket. There was nothing special or fancy about this experience and I felt terrible that this was my boyfriend's first high tea experience. I have never been so embarrassed. Even with the coupon I felt ripped off, I can't imagine paying full price for this - Capstone, please stick to fondue!\n","\n","We finished our food within  -  minutes and left hungry. I never want anyone to think that this is what high tea is about, so this review had to be written... Please check out legit high tea places like Adorabelle Tea Room or Secret Garden instead!\n","I've been to this restaurant a few times and their service has been consistently questionable. Service and attentiveness was lacking every time when I visited for both lunch and dinner. It was brought to my attention that they had a pasta promotion so we took the risk and tried again. I'm pretty sure that was my last visit and I will avoid eating there again. \n"," \n","Service and attentiveness - There seemed to be an unfortunate \"nothing is my business\" mentality between the servers. Upon arrival, waiting at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign, multiple servers saw me standing there but it was not until I waved at a server that someone appointed another server to have me seated. I was ready to order and notified a server and I was told that she would get my server; I waited   minutes and had to flag down a server and when he came up to our table, there was no helpfulness and he made me feel as if I was inconveniencing him. Our dishes were practically tossed and dropped at our table. My spoon was caught under a plate and almost went flying off the table when a dish was dropped off, the server noticed it and apologized but he was already walking away almost completely turned around. The rest of the dishes came but the server would just drop them off at the edge of the table closest to them. When we were ready for the bill, I had to ask twice again. The first server I approached for the bill came back into our area serving another table but no bill for us, and then I had to flag down another server for our bill. It shouldn't be this difficult for standard basic service at a restaurant. \n"," \n","Honoring a promotion - I fully understand that there will always be a catch when ordering from the special promotional menu. There was a   for   pasta promotion; order   pasta dishes and pay for  . The pasta dishes were unusually small but we understand that it was a promotion so we accepted it. At one point we considered ordering more because the pasta dishes were very small; however, the service was such a turn off that we opted out. The experience was not great but somewhat expected. It wasn't until the next day when we saw the ad again and noticed that along with the pasta, garlic bread, salad and appetizers were included.  Salad and appetizers never came. \n"," \n","If the servers don't enjoy serving, get a different job. When customers order from the special menu and can't get the same treatment as customers ordering from the regular menu, don't offer a special menu. If not all inclusions form the promotional ad is honored/served, don't advertise a promotional menu. I recognize that Kyung Bok Palace is not fine dining but standard basic service in a restaurant setting is not too much to expect. \n","\n","Maybe it was just my bad luck and hope you all a better experience.\n","When I'm thinking of the staple wonton noodles and congee, this is what is popping in my mind when I am in Richmond. As most may know, or may not know, this place is under new ownership and from what I know the new owner is real good in the kitchen (past kitchen history at other big restaurants in the GVR) so coming here shouldn't be a question for your stomach. On my latest visit with my partner, her friend, and my brother in tow we were thinking prior to going that we would have a light meal, it became a feast!\n","\n","Everytime I am here, the place is never empty, whether lunch or dinner there are people in here, with their newspapers, or people needing a quick bite and don't sit too close to the doorway as there is an ongoing number of takeout orders from this place, so if you don't like the cold draft, stay out of the way. We got seated in one of their booth seats and away we went with our orders. A big bowl of duck egg and pork congee to start with some side plates which included a fresh batch of Chinese donuts, deep fried spicy tofu, scrambled eggs with shrimp, and fried long beans with beef. The food came piping hot directly from the kitchen. The steam was flowing through and we began to dig in. I didn't get any feeling of MSG being used, and each dish was flavourful but not over powering. The deep fried tofu was burning hot on the outside, and soft and silky on the inside. Accompanied by a small dipping dish of vinegar, this was comfort food. Playing with the big ladle in the pool of hot congee, they did not skimp out on the duck egg pieces, nor the meat slicing, evenly cut, plentiful, a good balance of congee and the other stuff. The use of the black bean sauce, combined with the beef and long beans was a nice touch, and our plate of greens for the night. The scrambled eggs weren't overcooked like a Denny's grand slam, and mixed with full pieces and every bite was perfect.\n","\n","We were getting near the end of polishing off all the dishes and my partner was still feeling the need to eat something. She then proceeded to order a mixture of the wonton and dumplings with noodles to complete her dinner. The dumplings and wontons were hidden under the bed of noodles, and each was a fair size, not overly huge but a good size. After this bowl was finally completed, we were stuffed, laying around not moving, suffering from a minor food coma, but happily satisfied.\n","\n","When you come here, be prepared to eat, the dishes aren't overly huge in size, they are fair and done right. Parking can be a problem in this little plaza as there are many eateries just in this one place, luckily the bottom part of the plaza is set as one way traffic with the amount of agonizing fun in a car you can have in Richmond! They do takeout also, and I came back a few days later just to get some freshly fried Chinese donuts. I will be back, but they have never failed me before.\n","Needed a little snack after hitting the gym and I haven't walked Aberdeen food court in quite a long time, what better place to figure out what you want to eat than a place with multiple selection? Exactly! Somebody said there was a stall that served stinky tofu up here, and finally I had a chance to taste this dish that the place was serving. Already, when I saw the name it intrigued me, as there was no reviews  online I would (as usual) have to judge for myself how this was going to be. There was a good amount of people in front of this stall, always a good sign in my books, and I looked at the menu to see what was cooking here.\n","\n","Aside from the menu you see while looking up from being in front of the stall they have these small paper ordering forms at the front. From what I see, you can choose to fill this out, pick your customized tofu hotpot out,  from a variety of   main ones, you can ask for spicy to non, no onions, no cilantro, add some tofu for a small nominal fee, and some extra fixings. On this day me and my dear just went straight to ordering the stinky tofu, no need to get to their complex dishes, just something simple. Their menu on this item wasn't clear, as the above menu had   pieces for $ . , and   for $ , pretty expensive, till we clarified this with the person that was working the front till. She said we would be getting   small pieces for $ . , so we decided to just order that, and wait while this dish was being fried up.\n","\n","Eventually, after about a good   minutes our order was ready for pickup. I think we both looked at the order for a good minute and were wondering 'huh' on what we saw. I know tofu isn't expensive, and I was expecting   small pieces, not this small. After getting past the microscopic portion my dear started questioning where are the sides... yes... where's the pickled vegetables? For anyone who has ever had stinky tofu, this is a staple, you don't just give the tofu and nothing, it's like ordering a hotdog, at least you get the bun, if you chose to not want it.. well that's your problem.. it felt like being cheated. There wasn't much sauce on top, and the slopped the spicy bean sauce on the side so ahead we went and picked at our food with the chopsticks provided. I started to look to see if this was going to satisfy my dear's taste buds on this.. as she is from the country where this dish is abundant, and when I didn't see any smile I dug in for the kill. To say I was disappointed was the exact answer, tofu isn't an expensive item, and to have this small dish for the price they were charging was a rip off. The scent, or what other races would call pungent, wasn't there, until you bit into these small things. Even the taste, while slightly there, satisfied the craving for a millisecond, and then it was gone. Usually I have a certain enjoyment with having what other people call smelly, and stinky, in my mouth, the flavours melding with the sauces put on top, then neutralizing that with the (missing) pickled vegetables is just such a delight.\n","\n","I may come back to try their other servings, but for their stinky tofu, yes, they serve it, but I have had better, and I'm not talking about Taiwan, or any other part of Asia, but in our own backyard here. If you need this fix, unfortunately you will be paying a premium for what you are getting. We will see if I can follow this up with their signature tofu hotpot dishes, but for now... this is what you're getting!\n","We go to the south terminal often, which is right across from the Flying Beaver.  The last time we were there a couple of years ago was a bad experience so we hadn't been frequenting it. \n","\n","However, we were at the main airport and were going to the south terminal and had    /  hours to kill.  We thought we would give this place another chance as it is close and does have a wonderful view.\n","\n","From the moment we walked in, we did not get a good impression.  The music was to loud to talk comfortably.  The place needed a good clean.  The tables were dirty. \n","\n","We selected a table but their was a note saying something like \"you can sit here, but if people we like stop by you will be asked to move\".    Why not put a reserved sign on it?  We moved on, found another table and sat down.  The waitress did come over promptly to get our drink order  When I only wanted water, her attitude was disdainful.  However, I got the water when the others got their drinks. \n","\n","We had decided to order the wings special.  Oh boy, the rules.  First we each had to have a real drink, water was not acceptable.  OK, I ordered a beer and gave it to my husband.  My husband ordered   hot wings, which was ok.  But my Grandmother and I each ordered  .  Not acceptable, the minimum was  .  Again, ok, we ordered   each.   They came covered in goop and were not very good.  We each ate a couple but couldn't continue as the sauce was overpowering.  We did eat the decent yam fries.\n","\n","Up until this point we took the rules in stride.  But when we asked the waitress to wrap the wings up so we could take them home, she informs us we can only take a maximum of   wings with us.  When I explained we could not eat them all and didn't want to order that many anyways, she said \"I explained you had to order  \".  Yes, she did, but she did not explain we would have to eat the all of them.  She informed us she would pack up   and throw the extras away, or we could eat them.  At this point I snapped \"Who makes these ridiculous *)(*& rules?\".  She stomped off and refused to come back. \n","\n","So I asked to speak to the manager.  He eventually came over and started chewing me out for swearing at the waitress.  I apologized and tried to explain our situation, and that all I wanted was to take the leftovers home but he just kept explaining the rules to us over and over.  Finally I said there is no point in continuing this conversation, could we please have our bill so we could leave.  He then continued to talk, but he became angry because I cut him off.  He just wouldn't go away.\n","\n","It's ridiculous really, we are good customers, pleasant, take situations as they occur and tip well.   All we ask is that we get treated fairly and with respect.  I understand they need to have rules surrounding their specials, but come on, don't make me order more food than I want then tell me I either have to eat them or throw them out, but still have to pay for them.\n","\n","Well, the best way to vote is by not bothering to go back and you can be sure that is what we will do.\n","As many Asian restaurants there are around, there aren't that many Filipino restaurants in comparison.  There's a lot more in Vancouver but that's too far for me when I need something just nearby. Little Ongpin is the closest to where I live, the food is actually pretty good (great value too) and the service is superb.\n","\n","The atmosphere is really casual and everyone is friendly. This is very typical of Filipino settings; it reminded me of social events and gatherings back in the Philippines. It's very warm and inviting, which makes it a plus for me. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. My parents know a lot about Filipino food, which speeds up the process of ordering (I know a lot too but they know a lot more and this helps when I'm up to trying something new).\n","\n","Around the table, we ordered the Chopsuey (sauteed, mixed vegetables), the Miki Bihon (Chinese style noodles), Pork Sisig (pork sizzling plate), Diniguan (pork blood stew), Chicken BBQ skewer with atchara (atchara is pickled papaya), Lechon Kawali (roasted pork), Garlic fried rice and Taho (tofu with sweet syrup and tapioca pearls) for dessert. I also ordered their pineapple juice.\n","\n","Because we've dined here before, I was expecting our food to be good overall; and it was. The Chopsuey was average. The snow peas and the red pepper were cooked just right and I loved the quail egg in there. The cauliflower was a bit overcooked, but I did like the syrupy sauce that it was in. The Miki Bihon is, again, more a Chinese dish than Filipino, but Filipino cuisine has tons of Chinese influence in it. Really love the fact that there's tons of protein and vegetables and not just the noodles. Squeeze the lemon wedge too if you want to brighten up the dish. It was quite greasy and it was kinda swimming in the sauce. Wasn't a fan of that but I still liked it. The Pork Sisig was one of my faves; the dish usually consists of chopped pig's head and liver but there was no liver in this dish. It was definitely delicious; I really like the crunch too. The red onion adds a nice interesting flavour and the lemon helps cut the fat down. This is really needed as it's quite a fat based dish. Really love the aroma of it too.\n","\n","My other favourite was the Diniguan. Now we often get weird looks from people who find out that this is what it is, but I know a lot of non Filipinos who have tried this and found it delicious. Try it when you're feeling up to it. Anyway, this version of the Diniguan is actually pretty good. I like that the sauce is thick; I've tried some before where the sauce is quite liquidy and I didn't really like that (to each their own). My mom was quite impressed with this version too. She liked it (and she's quite hard to please).  Not a fan of spicy stuff so I didn't bother with the jalapeno that came with it. \n","\n","The Chicken BBQ skewer was absolutely tasty! The meat is so juicy and it had a very nice BBQ flavour to it. The atchara was a really nice addition as it added a nice hint of sweetness to it each bite. The Lechon Kawali is another favourite of ours, particularly by my brothers. Love the huge portions and the roasted taste. We always get this with the garlic fried rice, which could use a bigger portion. There was, however, just enough garlic. Quite tasty.\n","\n","My pineapple juice was very refreshing. Tasty, but I doubt they used fresh pineapples. It tasted like it was canned pineapple juice. I wasn't very impressed with the Taho. The tapioca used isn't the same one that street vendors in the Philippines use; the ones used were the bubble tea kind of tapioca - bigger and black compared to small transparent ones. The syrup was also quite watery and the tofu was really light. Not very authentic. \n","\n","Overall I loved my experience. Our server checked up on us often, but not often enough to make it annoying. In addition, the bathrooms were tiny but very clean.  The dishes are well priced; definitely worth the value. \n","\n","Would I come back? Most definitely.  You should check this place out if you're in the neighbourhood and are wanting to explore exotic Filipino cuisine.\n","Bamboo Grove Chinese Restaurant, Richmond, BC   / / \n","We have a wonderful meal and a lot of left over to take home\n","\n","We heard this restaurant serve \"Pork Stomach and Gingko Long Boiled Soup\"  Pork Stomach and Gingko Long Boiled Soup\" , is my favor soup when I was a kid eating at home.  This is very common family type of cheap soup served from time to time in an average family dinner. It's tasty and cheap to make. It always with Gingko; dry soy bean curd; ginger (lot of ginger to take away the smell and taste of the pig stomach aroma) and if you want it tasty better and look more expensive, add some dry mushroom, boiled it  -  hours, you will have a wonderful dinner soup. There is no secrete and nothing to it, except for the labor to clean up the pig stomach before cooking it. I wonder why the CRA awarded them a GOLD WITH DISTINCTION AWARD for this dish.  The CRA judgment is questionable. What DISTINCTION?  This type of soup is being served in family in South China for hundred of years!!\n","\n","Since I haven't had this soup for long time, (it appears that no restaurant in the Greater Vancouver area served this soup) I must order one to day.  The waiter tells me we have to order ahead of time for this soup. Luckily the manager say they still have a small order and we can have. I was so happy to order it without ask the price and how small is the small size.  And we also pick up a combo dinner for   for $ . . The menu indicated we can choice   items from almost   items from the menu.  We didn't really look at menu, because we were so happy that they give us the last small bowl of  \n","Pork Stomach and Gingko Long Boiled Soup\"    .  We causally pick   items from the menu for the combo dinner. \n","\n","They serve the soup first, to my surprise, the small size of the Pork Stomach and Ginkgo Long Boiled Soup\"     is very big, bigger than the big served in other restaurant.  It consists of a big plate of ingredients (pig stomach; ginkgo nuts; soybean curd; lean pork meat and ginger) a big bowl of soup. After we ate the ingredients and soup, we almost full and still have a lot of ingredients and soup left.  When the   item combo dinner come up, we have no room to eat any more but I taste them and it all looks very good and taste very good.  As mentioned earlier, I didn't know the price of the soup and the size of the small size. It turn out the soup cost $ . In my opinion $  for that soup is too expensive even it's very big for small size. I would like they served half of the small size for half of price $ . Since I know now the size and price of that dish, I will not order that again. Because you don't just have soup for dinner, you like other dishes too. Other than that, this is a very good restaurant, service  is excellent.\n","They have good food and good price. Highly recommended.\n","I visited Yuu way back in February   just before covid   hit with a couple of friends of mine. (I know this review is super long-winded so skip to the TL;DR part at the end if you don't want to read it all.)\n","\n","Found a nice coupon deal online where you can get their cream curry udon combo and milk tea for only $ . ! (normally over $ ) so i decided to try this place out.\n","\n","Location wise, as a transit user, it is pretty convenient. The plaza where it's located is kitty corner from Aberdeen centre skytrain skytrain station. Just a short   minute walk.\n","\n","As soon as we came in, we were welcomed by the restaurant host and then served (lukewarm) japanese green tea and given menus as soon as we were seated.  The tea tasted alright and not too watered down. \n","\n","First impression of the decor is the table seating arrangement is spacious. Some other restaurants i've been to around vancouver are more cramped but this one gives ample table space between customers which i like.\n","They have nice and comfy dining chairs. These are not your regular dining chairs that only pads your bottom. No, these are the more premium chairs which pads your upper back as well. Thet dark wood tables compliment the comfy vibe of the whole dining area. There was actually a lot of thought behind the design of the restaurant. \n","Soft modern love songs at a medium volume played in the background. \n","Paper lanterns hang on the ceiling with warm lighting\n","All these elements kinda gave a comfortable vibe. \n","They also hung homemade informational hand-written posters in english about japanese food which was a nice touch. \n","\n","The ambience seems to depend on the time of day and how busy it is. It was pretty quiet in the beginning but it got really busy after  .\n","It's quiet if a few tables are occupied but gets VERY loud when the place is packed. You'll have yell a bit to talk when it's packed.\n","\n","As for food, I ordered a hot caramel milk tea.\n","Caramel milk tea tasted artificial but it was still tasty. Nothing to write home about here, a lot of places have similar taste of caramel milk tea like this. It's decent. The problem is the waitress gave me a cold caramel milk tea. It was not hot as I requested. I didn't say anything though because i drank through half of it already and it was quite busy. It was prettyhard getting the waitress attention so I just  drank it.\n","\n","First impression of the cream curry udon just by itself was that it's not bad overall.\n","Just based on taste, it was not bad. It had a sort of thin, silky smooth layer of mashed potatoes with japanese brown curry and udon noodles. \n","\n","I like how they also provided an ample amount of sliced bit sized pieces of red daikon and fresh raisins to add as toppings.  It definitely enhanced the flavor of the udon.\n","Panko shrimp tempura was included on the side. THAT was really delicious. It had thick and crispy breading and it was cooked well overall. I really enjoyed the crispy texture and flavor of it.\n","\n","By itself, the cream curry udon only had a subtle flavor. But when combined with the toppings mentioned above and the shrimp tempura side dish, it gives it a MUCH fuller flavor. That's when I realized the cream curry udon, toppings, and shrimp tempura definitely should be combined and eaten together. OK, now that's good stuff!! \n","\n","My friend ordered the same thing as I did and he thought the curry was \"pretty good.\"  Portion wise, the curry was an ample amount. \n","\n","I was actually pretty stuffed at the end because the combination of tea, potato based curry, and the milk tea surprisingly fills you up big time.\n","\n","Some of the dislikes I have is that the washrooms only have single stalls. It's inconvenient for a medium sized  + patron restaurant to have single occupancy washrooms for each gender. It wasn't free for a while when I needed to use it.\n","\n","Another dislike is that the staff needs to work on their demeanor towards customers. The host at the front gave a kind of a cold vibe with no smiles or saying welcome or thanks for coming. Also, a lot of effort was needed to get the waitress attention to ask for a bill. It took a long time to try to get her attention.  Service from our waitress was pretty indifferent with no hello or thank you. Just take the order and walk away quickly.\n","\n","Despite all the dislikes listed above, for the price I paid for my meal on this visit, i thought it was good experience overall. Just came for the good food. I may come back and try their other curry someday if i'm craving japanese curry. \n","\n","TL;DR i give it a  .  out of   rounded up to  . It's definitely worth a try for their awesome cream curry udon combo! Their milk tea tastes decent. Their slow, indifferent service could use improvement. Don't come after   if you want a kinda quiet ambience because it will be super loud and packed.\n","This review might skew the ratings a little bit but definitely think my experience was worth it's stars. \n","\n","There's a promo going on right now where it's  % off at the Richmond store until Feb     so I definitely wanted to check this place out because a food deal is always a great deal! \n","\n","First off, service was great when I arrived at   on a Tuesday night but also cause I was the only customer. Because of a bad sprain, I went into the cafe with crutches and once the staff members saw, they were more than welcoming and advised that I'd have a seat first and they'd bring the menu to me, instead of me standing at the display case and the menu. I got a seat and they brought over their menu which is on a pamphlet. She came over to take my order, came over to hand me the bill, came to collect the change, brought over my cake and even asked if I needed a glass of water with it. Both staff members were super welcoming and very kind with their service. I've been on crutches for quite some time now and it was the best customer service I've gotten so I'm very touched by their kindness. \n","\n","When I arrived, they only had five types of cakes in the display case but there's several more on the menu. I originally wanted to come to try their matcha mousse cake but they were sold out so I opted for the mango mousse which was also sold out...so I ended up ordering the matcha cheesecake since I didn't want to have come all the way here without trying something on the menu. \n","\n","I'm actually not a fan of cakes and usually when I go to a cafe, I'm that person who'll get coffee but like I said, I came all the way here (crutches and all) to try their cakes so I had to try one. \n","\n","I don't eat cheesecake at all. I've never had cheesecake from cheesecake factory either because there's something about the texture and the taste that doesn't really work with me but I had ordered the matcha cheesecake so I really wasn't expecting much but dang! Is this what matcha cheesecake normally tastes like? It was surprisingly great. The cheesecake is not as creamy as I imagined it to be and the cake is in layers because of it's ombre green presentation, there's also a chocolate cookie base on the bottom but if you're slicing down the cake, the matcha cheesecake is one part and the cookie is another. They're not exactly \"together\" but I have no idea if that's what it is or isn't supposed to be because like I mentioned, I don't eat cheesecake BUT it was so good that I bought another piece to go! It was that good!! Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing though... \n","\n","Also got a slice of their London Fog cake to go. I'm more of a green tea person so I don't like black teas either (Yes. Pretty much just got their cakes for the sake of buying them) but the London fog cake has such a nice tea flavor it almost felt like I was halfway to eating a bubble tea kind of cake. The sponge cake that they use in the cake isn't as fluffy as it may look. It is a little denser than what I'm used to; more of a packaged castella texture but I'm not complaining. Really enjoyed the cakes! \n","\n","Am definitely considering ordering the whole London fog cake for my birthday cause I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend you come here for meetings and to study as well since they've got a gigantic space and tons of tables\n","I've been coming to Neptune Wonton Noodle since I was a kid and it's one of the few restaurants I regularly go back to. On my most recent trip back home, it had the honours of being my first stop after I landed in Vancouver.\n","\n","It was  :  on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed! Not having had dinner yet--since I was saving my appetite for yummy Vancouver food--I was absolutely famished! Even on the plane I was thinking about which dishes I wanted to get and as a result I definitely had a case of \"eyes wider than my stomach\". Luckily, my mom sympathized with my deprivation of good Chinese food in SF and let me loose when it came time to order :)\n","\n","The menu is quite large and contains all the usual suspects--congee, noodle soup, fried noodle, tossed noodle, fried rice, snacks, meat/seafood entrees, and some Chinese desserts. They also have a large selection of \"night snacks\" available from  - . Like most Chinese restaurants, the service was prompt and the food came fairly quickly. (Thank god!) True to my over-ordering self, we got   dishes and   desserts between the two of us. They were all FANTASTIC!! (except for one). Everything was so flavourful and yummy that I kept eating well after I was full. \n","\n","- Sliced fish with thousand year old egg and cilantro soup ( ): Yum! Flavourful broth with a great combo of ingredients and a strong peppery taste.\n","- Stir-fried water spinach with fermented bean curd ( ): Lots of fermented bean curd flavour with some spicy red chilies to give it a little kick.\n","- Shrimp wonton and shrimp & pork dumpling combo in soup ( ): Huge plump wontons and dumplings loaded with fresh crunchy soft shrimp ( ) so flavourful there was no need for red vinegar.\n","- Sticky rice wrap with abalone and conpoy in bamboo leaf ( ,  ): Tasty but I've had better. Pricey too--there was only one teeny tiny abalone ( ) that I had to tear apart the whole dish to find.\n","- Chiu chow-style fish balls with flat rice noodle in soup ( ): I LOVE THIS DISH!! I haven't found fish ball noodle soup as good anywhere else. The AMAZING broth is creamy and flavourful, fish balls/slices are soft and \"bouncy on the teeth\", noodles are perfectly cooked, and bean sprouts and preserved Chinese cabbage add crunchiness with the latter adding even more flavour\n","- Sauteed tiger prawns with spicy eggplant ( ): Incredibly flavourful with lots of garlic and dried shrimp\n","- Whole mullet fish on stove ( ): Fish itself was ok but it can easily get overcooked on the tabletop stove. The best parts were the sour-but-well-balanced broth and the fragrant Chinese celery.\n","- Black sesame paste ( ): BAD BAD BAD!! First, they burnt it and I had to send it back. (They refused to just cancel the order and made us wait for another one.) Although the second one I got wasn't burnt it was still really gross--bland, lumpy, and clearly made from a mix and/or thickened with corn starch. \n","- Chocolate flavour ginger milk pudding ( ): Another favourite that I get every time. Very strong ginger flavour with a hint of chocolate. Love the soft not-quite-solid-but-not-quite-liquid custard texture.\n","\n","After this late dinner I was bloated but happy. I got back to my mom's house, threw my luggage to the side, and collapsed into a huge food coma. I woke up still feeling stuffed the next morning... It pretty much set the tone for the rest of my visit =P\n","  West Coast Grill, formerly known as American Grill, opened its door to the public few months ago after a big renovation with the Vancouver Airport Marriott. I have never been to American Grill before, so I am not able to compare the decor between the two. But the revamp is definitely eye-catching. The earthy and marble decor and ambiance adds a comfortable and relaxing feel to the restaurant.\n","\n","  West Coast Grill features cuisine from the Pacific Northwest, with a combination of signature dishes that best represent Canada. The menu focuses on shared plates while having a wide selection of entrees, such as the recent feature of halibut. If you are only looking for a drink, you can choose from the extensive menu of wine, beer, and cocktail.\n","\n","I tried multiple shared plates, and my first favourite is the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. Using three different kinds of cheese, aged cheddar, mozzarella, and Gruyere cheese, the flavor is rich and creamy. And I really enjoy watching the endless cheese pull with this dish. The bougie part of this dish is the generous amount of lobster meat, so make sure you grab a bit of everything to enjoy the dish at its fullest.\n","\n","Fried Cauliflower & Brussel Sprouts is a classic appetizer to start off the meal. It is light and simple. Truffle oil is lightly coated on the vegetables, and they are seasoned with garlic, parmesan, and parsley. Spicy mayo is on the side as a dipping sauce. The seasoning is on point; however, I hope the Brussel sprouts are crispier to add a crunchy texture to the dish.\n","\n","Meat Balls is another classic tapas for most occasion. It uses pork, veal, and beef, which gives a tender and smooth texture. I hope the meatball itself has more flavor, maybe a pinch of salt or simmer in the roasted tomato sauce for a longer time.\n","\n","I have never tried Blackened Halibut Collars before, which I found unique to find the dish at   West Coast Grill. Chef Danilo recommends us to squeeze all the lemon juice out to season the halibut collars. The meat is tender and juicy, but unfortunately, there is not much flavor in the center. Otherwise, it would be such an amazing dish.\n","\n","Lamb Chops is my second favourite dish because  ) I love lamb  ) the seasoning is on point. Crushed peanuts and chimichurri sauce lies on the tender lamb chops. I recommend enjoying this dish with hands. It tastes so good that I can even lip off my fingers!\n","\n","Pork Belly Adobo is very similar to the Chinese crispy pork belly, but it is actually a Philippine dish. The pork belly was first braised, then fried. It is seasoned with soy sauce, vinegar, and spices. Pickled green papaya lightens the heaviness from the dish, as well as the garlic chips. The skin is crispy, and the meat is so tender that it melts in my mouth.\n","\n","Overall Impression\n","\n","Although I have never been to American Grill, the redesigned   West Coast Grill does not disappoint me. According to Chef Danilo, the menu keeps some signature and popular items from the old menu, as well as adding new components to it. I am surprised that my favourite dish is the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese because it is not as heavy as I expected. It makes a perfect shared plate with small groups of friend. I also recommend the Lamb Chops, because it is tender and juicy. The crushed peanut and chimichurri also adds flavor and crunchiness to the dish. The convenient location and relaxing ambiance make this restaurant an awesome choice for happy hour or dinner.\n","\n","Taste :  /  * Ambiance:  . / \n","First of all, this location is the best out of all three in Richmond in terms of accessibility and convenience. It isn't located in an airport, it isn't floating on water, and you can get to it any way you can think of - lots of free parking,   bus stops pretty much right outside, bike friendly, etc.\n","\n","One thing to note about Pajo's is that it is not a fast food chain, even though it looks and mostly operates like one. I haven't been to any of the other locations (well, I guess I have been to the airport location, but haven't ordered from there), but from my experience at this one, I can say that your orders will not be ready in a few minutes unless you're only getting fries, poutines, soups or salads. If it's slow, your food will most likely be done within ten minutes, but I've had to wait up to half an hour during busier times.\n","\n","The fish and chips aren't prepared at a factory and ready to go as soon as an order is placed. The fish comes frozen, but they still hand-batter the pieces (speaking of batter, that's also something they prepare in store) and fry them from raw instead of merely reheating something fully prepared and frozen for storage. The fries are also cooked from raw potato chips through several stages of frying; this can actually be seen through observation of the kitchen. While I have no complaints about the fries, the size of the fish pieces has been quite inconsistent in recent years. I don't know if they're pre-cut at an off-site facility or cut in store, but to sum it all up, you can come in one day and get giant pieces of fish, then return tomorrow to order the same thing and get tiny pieces.\n","\n","Everything else is a different story: soups are microwaved, salads are thrown together from prepared ingredients (unless you order the salmon caesar salad, which is mostly thrown together except for the piece of fish which is cooked on a grill), hot dogs appear to be fully cooked and are merely browned on the grill. The only exceptions are burgers and tacos, as the meat you choose to have in such items (beef, fish or shrimp) must be cooked (but everything else is still thrown together). With all that being said, this is a fish and chips restaurant which just so happens to serve these items (likely for convenience, since the McDonald's in Steveston is gone and the only other food places close to this Pajo's are a Japanese and Mexican restaurant. Therefore, come for fish and chips, get one of their other items if you must, but you're better off going somewhere else if that's what you want.\n","\n","The Garry Point location's staff is extremely diverse, ranging from young teenagers for whom Pajo's is probably their first employer, to older adults who seem to be food industry veterans, all from different backgrounds. Staff members are generally friendly and good at their jobs, but some of the cooks seem easily overwhelmed by high traffic: when it's slow, the food I receive is usually properly cooked and well-presented, and staff may go above and beyond by picking out the largest pieces of fish they could find, for example. When it's busy, however, some of the cooks seem like they're playing catch-up and go from \"let's try to make the best food possible\" to \"let's try to get these orders out the window as quickly as possible.\" Busier times are when I tend to receive undercooked and poorly presented food. Luckily, management at this location is great as they'll always make the cooks properly redo your order (and they flat out refuse to take the bad food back into the kitchen, telling you to do whatever you want with it instead, which is amazing since most other restaurants will take it back).\n","\n","One last thing to note is that Pajo's corporate (since I have observed what I'm about to describe at the airport location as well) appears to be heavily committed to the government's initiative to ban plastic straws by  . Their solution, unlike most establishments, is to not offer any straws at all and serve cold drinks with coffee cup lids instead. If you try to ask for a straw, they will be unable to provide you with one since they don't even keep any around. Therefore, if you plan on going to this Pajo's or any other one with someone who NEEDS a straw, you'll have to remember to bring your own.\n","\n","With all that being said, Pajo's at Garry Point is a solid fish and chips place with a great location. Your experience will be great if you go when it's slow (although busier times are still fine as management will fix things for you if they don't go right) and I still don't know of any other establishments in the area offering refillable fries.\n","Double Double re-upped\n","\n","Last visit: Feb  ,  \n","\n","Last Sept, the Mrs wanted to try a local hidden gem, the highly rated HK style \"Double Double Restaurant & Wonton\"\n","\n","First, this isn't Michelin dining; just budget friendly Chinese food.\n","\n","But the quality of food that arrived exceeded expectations; both quality & quantity. We started with the Chinese doughnut in rice noodle (crispy donut in rice noodle)... Crispy, not greasy, and the portion was huge!   stars. $ , they also have a half portion for $ . . We've always ordered the full portion.\n","\n","Next came the crispy won tons (crisped to perfection, not greasy, and ample dipping sauce), made with very fresh shrimp.   stars. A must have every time. At $ . , *cheaper* than most food court ones, with better ingredients and a larger portion.\n","\n","The Thai style fried rice which included a poached egg with a nice runny yolk when I shredded the egg through the rice. One of the best Chinese fried rices we've ever had.   stars.\n","\n"," Finally their signature sweet & sour pork (all meat, no bone, fat or inedible tendon). While very good, wasnt as elevated as the others.   stars\n","\n","The dishes all arrived quickly, weren't greasy, and best of all, the bill at the end was only $ . The single most expensive, and ironicaly least mind blowing dish was the sweet & sour pork (pork was very high quality meats, but I expected a more intense flavour, given that it was a signature dish. Still very good, though)\n","\n","This is definitely going into the rotation. Oh, and they actually accept debit cards (many local Chinese restaurants are cash only).\n","\n"," *And* we actually had leftovers!\n","\n","Subsequent visits: Changed the black pepper beef noodle to crispy noodles; very high quality ingredients, but wish the black pepper flavour were more intense. However, it was one of the best beef chow mein I've ever had; just not much black pepper flavour.  .  stars.\n","\n","Thick satay beef noodle is very standard, again fresh ingredients but wish the flavour were more intense.  .  stars.\n","\n","On our   visit we tried the honey garlic spareribs instead of sweet and sour pork. Even more flavourful.  .  stars.\n","\n","Our most recent visit, we ordered stir fried fish with vegetables. The brocolli was *excellent*, and the fish, while subtly flavoured, was again fresh and well cooked, hitting that sweet spot between undercooked and overcooked.  .  stars.\n","\n","Overall:\n"," . /  stars  . / \n","Each time, the food has arrived quickly, and the service was good. Note that as per usual with casual Asian restaurants, you may have to share a table (with strangers) when it's busy. This is normal.\n","\n","Recommended: cripsy won tons, Thai style fried rice, chinese fried donut in rice noodles, (these first   are must haves for your first visit)  black pepper beef chow mein (off menu; ask them to change the black pepper beef udon to chow meins),  honey garlic spareribs, stir fried fish with vegetables (broccoli).\n","\n","Avoid: *nothing* so far, but the sweet and sour pork and the thick satay beef rice noodles were very standard (non-oily with fresh ingredients, but nothing extraordinary). Likewise the HK style iced tea is good, but a little too \"tea-y\" for my taste.\n","\n","Located at unit  ,   No   Rd, Richmond, BC   4E4\n","first time here in a really long time, and i must say i was very very impressed with the food and ambiance. \n","\n","its a sister company of empire seafood restaurant which is just a few steps away...\n","\n","got there no reservations, told would be a   min wait. seated promptly after   mins. clean white table cloth and utensils. given the usual menu with a tick box ...\n","\n","ordered siu mai, sticky rice with pork, and chinese sausage, har gaw, egg tarts, rice roll with chinese donut, rice roll with shrimp, chicken feet and steamed spareribs. \n","\n","the siu mai was amazing! delicate and tender morsels of pork topped with fish roe. it was steamed to tender perfection that it nearly fell apart when held with chopsticks. seasoned perfectly and tasted juicy and sumptuous. best part, it was huge!! \n","\n","the har gaw was executed perfectly too. the skin or wrapper made the difference. it was thin but held the shrimp really well. the shrimp was plump and juicy and tasted fresh. \n","\n","the egg tarts were freshly made with a french flaky crust. the center was tender, soft, and moist. perfect timing in steaming this as the egg was cooked just right. \n","\n","rice rolls with donut and shrimp were fantastic. perfect presentation. rice roll wrapper was thin and just right...donut was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy inside. perfect texture and crunch to chewy ratio. shrimps were huge, plump, and fresh. both dishes were accompanied by their respective dips..creamy peanut and hoisin and sweet soy sauce. \n","\n","steamed spareribs were delicious as well. tender and not too salty. just right. the juices of the dish were aromatic and sweet, as the dish was steamed with pumpkin slices. great technique as the pumpkin absorbs the marinate and steams to softness as well. i equally enjoyed the little pumpkin pieces included in the dish. \n","\n","not a fan of chicken feet so didnt try that. but my wife who is a connoisseur of chicken feet, said they were cooked well and the sauce was amazing. i saw her enjoy every bit up to the bone. \n","\n","last but not least, my ultimate vote of greatness goes to the steamed sticky rice wrap. it was really freakin good! the sticky rice was cooked perfectly. portion was big. inside, the pork pieces were huge, they used bbq pork which just took the dish to another level. the chinese sausage were diced and spread throughout. i really enjoyed this dish. the craftsmanship that went into cooking the sticky rice should be applauded. very well executed. the dish easily fell apart even with just chopsticks. \n","\n","price-wise...hmm...lets just say you get what you pay for. the dimsum is as good if not better than hk. you can taste the quality and skill in every bite. one of the best for sure...plus, they have chiu chow items as well. for around   orders for   adult   kids, bill around to $  with tip. everyone left happy and satisfied, without the msg heavy feeling!\n","\n","now why   stars?? ...it was the service! they need more. although they moved quick and orders came out quick, calling the attention of servers for napkins, tea, or water was a pain. couple simply refused to make eye contact and would pretend not to see you, even when its so clear that you are calling them. typical asian style attitude. but when a request is made, they get what you need asap and dont forget, like other places. it was a busy lunch service with people lining up, but still, never lose track of your clients!! \n","\n","overall, we would go back! there are more items that we do want to try and experience. and for next time, try the other restaurant just a few doors down. \n","\n","cheers! happy eating!!\n","Multiple attempts but only eaten here twice. The parking sucks 'cause it's so limited. Even if there's free spots it's probably reserved for the other business nearby. My first time was during lunch and it's the same issue with parking but we were lucky 'cause someone was leaving. Another thing is that this place is cash and debit only, which was surprising considering how fancy it looks. I'd expect them to accept credit but hey, it's Richmond afterall.\n","\n","First visit:\n","\n","TORI X SPICY MISO RAMEN ( / ): The broth is on the thicker side and had great flavour. What I liked most was their aburi chashu. Their marinated egg is pretty good too. There are about   options and each are related to the amount of toppings you get. The best value is the one with   slices of aburi chashu. Also 'cause I really like the chashu. It's melt in your mouth and has a char taste to it. But if you're not into fatty meat (the main reason why it melts in your mouth anyways) then this is probably not the place for you. \n","\n","Deep fried Spring Chicken with OROSHI YUZU Ponzu Sauce ( . / ): Good flavouring to the chicken but not the best chicken kaarage that I've had. The sauce isn't really necessary but I like to alternate at times. Good to have as your side if you think you're ramen isn't filling enough. \n","\n","Mochi Dessert ( / ): I can't quite remember if these came in pairs or by the piece. They do come out a bit hard and requires some time to defrost a bit for better enjoyment. Unless you like rock solid mochis. They're nice to have at the end of the meal. Not too sweet and sort of cleanses your palate from the richness of the ramen broth. \n","\n","Second visit:\n","\n","TSUKEMEN ( . / ): The menu advertises as having  % more noodles and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to finish. Either I was hungry or it was really good I did manage to finish it all. I was stuffed and of course no dessert or appetizers were added. The noodles come out cold with a warm broth on the side to dip. The broth is thick with cubes of aburi chashu and other ramen toppings that I never really pay attention to. With this dish you also get a thermo with soup broth to add to to your dipping broth so you can enjoy at the end of your meal as a soup. The noodles tasted good and the broth was rich and had the right amount of spice. However I did notice that when you add the clear broth to it, it gets spicier but sadly at that point the broth would have been too diluted for dipping your noodles. Again, I love their aburi chashu so I got that on the side for $ . .\n","\n","I'd say this would be my top ramen place to go in Richmond but .... I don't like being disappointed and hope they can improve their parking space to accommodate more diners. Plus the two times I've been, they weren't a full house which they can easily be. Just saying.\n","This is the second year of Feast: Asian Dining Festival, which you can dine in   participating restaurants in Richmond with a discounted price or special set menus featuring their signature dishes. This festival features a variety of cuisines, including Chinese, Indian, Korean,  Persian, and Japanese, so there must be a suitable restaurant for everyone. The festival is happening from now until November  ,  . I collaborated with Feast and Subaru to drive around Richmond and visit some participating restaurants. My first stop is Hotpot Palace, a high-end hotpot restaurant offering a $  set menu during the Feast Festival. \n","\n","While others are in love with The Dolar Shop and Haidilao, they often don't know or forget about another high-end hotpot restaurant in Richmond, near Gyukaku - Hotpot Palace. This is my first time visiting this place, but I've heard excellent reviews from my friends before. They currently have a $  special menu during the Feast Festival. I recommend booking a table from OpenTable prior to heading there because this special menu is only available for bar seat customers only. \n","\n","The $  set menu includes   pieces of nigiri sushi, a choice of broth with a single serving pot, a choice of meat, seafood platter, vegetable platter, fresh fruits, and dessert of the day. It may not sound a lot, but I didn't realize how much food there is until they arrive. \n","\n","I chose Macau Style Pork Bone Soup for the broth and AAA Angus Beef for the meat. The broth is light and flavourful. It comes with a huge pork bone in my soup, and I can't taste any MSG or feel thirsty after!  I am also surprised by the quality of the AAA Angus Beef. \n","\n","When the Seafood Platter and the Nigiri arrives, I was amazed by its gorgeous presentation. The platter has fresh fish slices, clams, mussels, shrimps, and scallops. The seafood is fresh and not fishy; the shellfish is not sandy. Even without any sauces, they taste flavourful and delicious because they absorb the pork bone soup. \n","\n","The next item is the Vegetable Platter, which is beyond my expectation. I thought it would be a basket of lettuce, but it turns out with a variety of vegetables and mushrooms! I also love the tofu packet, which has a cooked quail egg inside. \n","\n","I was  % full after finishing two-third of the set, but I can never skip the desserts. It comes with a small bowl of fresh fruits and a dessert of the day. I got a Soy Milk Panna Cotta with Red Bean. The texture is on point - silky and light. The pudding has a strong soy milk flavor, and it is best for people who have lactose intolerance.\n","\n","*** Overall Impression ***\n","\n","I am amazed and satisfied with the dining experience at Hotpot Palace. Though without the set menu, it can get quite pricey. But both the food quality and service are top-notch, and I truly think they are on par with The Dolar Shop. The restaurant is spacious, and it is not as packed as other hotpot places.  I am glad that the Feast Festival introduces me to this hotpot place, and I would probably bring Mr. next time for a bigger feast!\n","Good food (once warm), and terrible service. - Dine Out Experience. \n","\n","I wanted to take my Dad for a nice dinner before his flight, luckily its dine out so I thought I could take hime somewhere nice. Carvers was to say the least.... interesting. \n","\n","When I arrived, they were busy but they still had quite a few empty tables. It took them   to seat me which was fine but they sat people that came in after me, before me.\n","Which I was confused about because its all by reservation and there were empty two seaters?\n","\n","Anyways, I get sat without menus, and fairly promptly someone gave me bread and some water, and then left, so I assumed they were not my server. I continued to wait for my Dad who was running late. I ended up waiting   for him and in that time not one person asked me if I would like a drink or a menu. No one even acknowledged my existence. \n","\n","Finally, my Dad shows up and we wait another   minutes before my Dad got up and asked if we could have a server and some menus. The hostess gave us some menus, but still no server. Time passes, still no server but the hostess offered to refill our water so we prompt her again for a server. Finally, someone shows up to our table to take our order, she seemed rushed, annoyed, and didn't even apologize. We order. \n","\n","The food came out relatively quick when compared to the ordering process. I ordered the escargot and my dad ordered the oysters. Both dishes were luke warm on the verge of cold but we ate them anyways. The taste was at least good. We had ordered wine pairings for them but they never showed up, so half way through our appetizer we asked again for our wine, which came right as we finished the appies. \n","\n","At this point we called the manager. He was very nice and handled the situation well. He explained that he had a   party reso in the back and a few more private rooms that were full. My guess is that they were not staffed adequately for this. He offered to pay for our whole bill which was greatly appreciated. \n","\n","Next, we received our   New York Steaks with mashed potatoes and veg, both medium rare. The cook was good on the steak, but both dishes were very cold, seemed like they had been sitting for a loooong time. So we sent them back and ordered more wine. At least the wine was good. Our meals came out, and we were reassured that they were fresh. They were not, you could still see where my dad and I had cut into our steaks and the cook was different. It seemed microwaved. So again we called the manager. Sounds like the kitchen was slammed, but that was still inexcusable. \n","\n","Finally, after that whole situation we got fresh steaks and they tasted great. We continued with the rest of the night with no issues. We also got a new server somewhere along the line, her name is \"Jordana\" I believe. She was amazing, and was a saving grace for the whole evening. \n","\n","Next we ordered dessert, which were not cooked in house, and were not anything special.\n","\n","Over all my dad and I made the most of the situation and kept a good humour about us throughout the night. The meal was paid for and we left in good spirits.\n","I decided to give the Richmond Night Market another try, it's been   years since the last one. It also helped that I was constantly seeing advertisements on the Canada Line for the market. The posters looked like the front box of the Candy Land game. I am a sucker for anything cute with candy. \n","\n","Compared to   years ago, geographically it's easier to get to. It's only   block away from Bridgeport skytrain station in Richmond (  Block from the River Rock Casino). Even if you get lost, just follow the crowds. And the large neon duck flashing on the tower. \n","\n","Cost to get in is $ .  It's the best $ .  spent on a Friday night. The last time I spent $  on instant fun was when I put in a shiny toonie in a toy vending machine for a large glittery bouncy ball.  \n","\n","The best time to go is at  :  pm when it's cooler and the night is just starting to fall. Friday's are always the best time to go. It wasn't as crowded this weekend (Aug  ) since there was a competition of events with Pride weekend. It was easier to navigate through the crowd without it being a cattle herd situation given the conflict of major events in the city. If you really want to avoid the long line-up on a Friday (Saturday is just a mess) than go between  :  -  : , an hour before it closes. \n","\n","Don't be intimidated by the lines, it always looks long, however, it goes by extremely fast. The pacing in line moves a lot faster than inside.   \n","\n","For starters this is a huge improvement from the sad market that was   years ago. A lot of $$$ has been invested in making the grounds esthetically pleasing and appealing for a broader demographic. \n","\n","I love my food porn and there are plenty of stalls to satisfy my oral fixation: stalls that will make you go WTF, traditional but safe eats and of course the carnival favorites for those who can't wait   more weeks for the PNE. The food is very reasonably priced. Portions aren't large but will leave reasonable stomach real estate to try other awesome carnival treats. I came home with my clothes smelling like a collage of fried foods both traditional, weird and stuff that I would say, \"oh hells no.\" Either way it was a good reminder of the evening before laundry day. \n","Of course every other person was walking around with a bubble tea with a small LED light inserted resembling a lantern in the night. Let's not forget about those spiral fried potato on a stick. Truthfully I am a sucker for any food that is on a stick. If you like your basic ice cream cone, they have that to...with a twist of course. You get a half donut shaped corn tube that is injected with soft serve ice cream. It looks as though you're walking around with an erect penis that just came in your hands = awesome. \n","\n","Personally the coupon books, although a good idea by concept, aren't worth it as you end up spending and eating more than intended. Very bad for someone like myself on Weight Watchers. Just pay regular price and split the meals with a friend.  \n","\n","The carnival is situated below the flight path to the airport, therefore, you will hear loud planes going by. This in combination with the Disney favorites that are blared through speakers during the festival, you will have moments of booming noise but they are short lived. \n","\n","You can get dirt cheap sell phone cases which is what they primary advertise (and proud of it). The downfall is that I have a cell phone from  , no Iphone. It just dials and texts using the   number keypad as letters (one letter at a time). I didn't find a cell phone case for my   year old cell phone but the looks were priceless when I showed them my ancient phone. Young kids were looking at it as if it were an antique rare piece while others were looking at me weird 'cause I am the last to upgrade to the Iphone phenomenon. My mission failed but fun none the less in finding an impossible item. \n","\n","I love crazy cute socks....they had plenty at $  - $  per pair! Did I mention I love crazy socks. \n","Of course the booths contained stuff that no one really needs but are cool ideas such as the USB operated fish tank that doubles as a pen holder for your office. The best was the humidifier that can be converted using a water bottle. They had more kitsch than substance. If you lost your Sham Wow or need another, they have a booth for that to. \n","\n","There is a Candyland section with large cartoon candy sculptures (perfect for multiple snapies). It was abright color phenomenon that looked as though you were walking on the set of a Katty Perry video. A whole section catered to your weekend sugar coma. They have a lollipop garden as well. In the Candyland is a carnival area that mimics similar games to the PNE, just more fair in terms of winning (depending on the game). I don't need a large teddy bear but it's all about the bad ass status trophy when walking back to the skytrain at  :  pm.\n","Family was in Richmond visiting the temple, so we thought to have lunch in the area before leaving! Saw this new place have their \"Grand Opening\" sign up, so we decided to give it a try, it used to be the location of South Ocean. There wasn't a long wait in line for tables although it looked crowded, we were seated after about   minutes of waiting. The inside is quite nicely furnished now, but still the same small space. There is a $ /person charge, and the tea quality justifies this surcharge, it was very nice tea-- fragrant and light.\n","\n","I was looking through the menu while we waited, so we could place the order right as we sat down (hungry peeps). First to arrive was the Halibut with Scallions and Ginger in Premium Soy Sauce ($ . ). The halibut was cooked perfectly, juicy and flakey inside with a crispy exterior that was evenly coated with the soy sauce. Not overly seasoned, I quite enjoyed the piping hot fish. Wish there were more pieces considering the price we paid.\n","\n","Rice Roll Wrapped with Donut ($ . ) was an utter disappointment. The rice roll itself was mediocre, chewy but not quite \"smooth\". The Chinese donut was hard as a rock and over-fried. Normally it should be crispy on the outside with a bread-like interior. At least they put the soy sauce on the side.\n","\n","I saw the Beef Ball, Spare rib, Chicken Feet combo ($ . ) and was sold immediately. Sadly, this wasn't quite up to standard. The chicken foot was nice, and the beef ball was a good size and average texture/taste. The spareribs were actually seasoned nicely but more than half of it was tiny bits of meat with chunks of fat. There was ONE piece with bone in it (I like the ones with bone). So basically this was one super oily dish.\n","\n","Deep Fried Sesame Ball with Seasame paste ($ . ) wasn't freshly made to order, but was still relatively warm. Crispy outside but the dough inside wasn't chewy enough. The sesame paste was too gritty and sweet that it didn't flow nicely.\n","\n","I ordered Beef Omasum in Tom Yum Sauce ($ . ). It was like any other omasum dish, but I like their concept of putting in Tom Yum. I'd say it's a rather personal taste, since I enjoyed this dish, but my mom said it was weird.\n","\n","Didn't settle for regular shrimp dumplings, so we got Meat Rissoles with Crab ($ . ). Probably the most disappointing dish of the whole meal, possibly my whole dim sum eating life. The wrapping was soft and soggy, fell apart when touched, not chewy at all. The filling did indeed contain real crab, but it also did not hold and so... the dish just all fell apart before it reached any bowl. Similar to any good sushi, your dumpling is not meant to break apart before it reaches your bowl, the wrapping should be strong enough to hold it, yet still be soft, smooth, and chewy.\n","\n","Another combo dish, Steamed Tri-Buns ($ . ) should contain a custard bun, a BBQ pork bun, and a chicken bun. I say \"should\" because I got double of the BBQ pork bun *sadface* I asked a waiter to confirm I wasn't being stupid and not able to differentiate the two remaining buns (custard is round and easily distinguishable from the other two). These were good, the custard bun had flowy filling, as advertised and tasted pretty legit. The buns themselves were good texture and taste. I just wish I had a taste of that chicken bun now.\n","\n","Something with a fusion twist to it, since I don't think truffle is commonly in Chinese dishes, the Pork Shiu-Mai with Truffle ($ . ) arrived. These looked normal, with some truffle sauce on top. I did not like the taste of the truffle, it was slimey and tasted like concentrated Chinese mushrooms. The shiu mai itself was made with ground pork and had good bite to it. Average size.\n","\n","Lamb isn't commonly in dim sum, and I'm a sucker for lamb so...Pan Fried Lamb Pastry with Leeks ($ . ) was ordered. These buns were not worthy of the price we paid. Pan fried to a golden exterior with the bun being soft and moist, and the filling being all lamb, I liked the flavors. However, there were only three small buns. THREE.\n","\n","Still hungry, we ordered a Wonton Noodle Soup ($ . /bowl) expecting the usual wontons, but were surprised when they showed up more like pork and chive dumplings with no shrimp. The meat wasn't very fresh inside the dumplings, the wrapping was chewy and smooth though. Noodles weren't anything special, but I like the added touch of greens.\n","\n","I got the Pan Fried Tofu with Shrimp Paste ($ . ), the tofu was a big chunk with shrimp paste on top. Nicely fried, it was crispy and I like how they placed the sauce on the side. Shrimp paste met average standards.\n","\n","When I saw our bill was $ .  I freaked a little. Then I looked to see that they had charged us   people's worth of tea-- no wonder! Luckily I caught it, and they changed it. But still, paying more than $ /person for dim sum is a rarity for my family, so this was a surprise. Overall, good service, high quality tea, hit or mostly miss dim sum.\n","If it continues like this, it will disappear like the Chinatown Night Market, is the thought I had in my brain after leaving this place yesterday. How a few years and no new thoughts have pretty much put this place on life support. I came here with my dear, to waste some time after watching a movie, not knowing what to expect, but hearing that this place was pay to enter as well. It was Sunday night, and I started driving along Sweden Way to get into this outdoor market, and noticed that the traffic patrollers were guiding us along Vulcan Way, West toward No.  , so now to drive all the way to this place, you have to go along the back way of River Road, and guess what peoples.... parking is free! But now admission is $  a head.\n","\n","For me, it's all about value and worth, especially working in the system at one point of my life, I know how these 'Market's' function, with the cost of putting up a booth, but now also laying it on the clientele who is coming through the gate, I would have rather they try to charge the suspecting public paid parking, but since the times change, you change with the times. After paying at the front, we are given these plastic cards which you have to enter in the gate before going through, kinda cool, to illusion you from just spending a toonie to get your ass in here. When we walked in, I was wondering where all the people were, was this just a Father's Day hangover of people not coming, this place was desolate of much life, and even the busiest places (the food area) you could stretch your arms and twirl in a circle and still not hit anyone was an amazing sight.\n","\n","The food vendors at the night market now are duplicates of eachother, and there isn't that much selection to choose from. You will still get the big one-off vendor selling off har-gow and sui mai with soy sauce fried noodles, and you'll have the ever popular (over priced) hurricane potato. Squid seems to be the big thing these last few years, and some easier to prepare small snacks like deep fried tofu and skewers, most of these booths actually have another booth at the other Night Market, so you are not missing much coming here. I use to come here for one vendor, and even that one is gone now, replaced with a Thai vendor that has nothing on the menu that I would even order, it's a sad shame, and at least I can say that I came and ate at this market once this year.\n","\n","Going through the vendor's away from the food was a sorry sight, with your normal vendors selling cell phone cases and accesories, bra and panties, and a slew of sock vendors is what I saw. Your useless cheap China toys, and some simple, if not 'call the fasion police' ugly clothing, and that is what makes up this market.\n","\n","They seemed to have gotten a cute mascot to counter the yellow ducky of the other place, using two big air blown up panda's, the one at the exit looks disgruntled, and if it came alive, would probably boot you out of this place! There is a live stage in the middle of this market, having singers and other types of performers on there, doing something, and also a real life Shrek walking around the grounds greeting people.\n","\n","If what I saw yesterday continues, I sense that in   we will only have one Night Market in Richmond...... we will see!\n","Food:  / \n","Service:  . / \n","Cleanliness:  / \n","Atmosphere:  / \n","Price: $-$$\n","\n","Welcoming\n","Upon entering, no one was there to greet us. Waitresses were busy in the kitchen wrapping up orders, sushi chefs were quietly working, and few customers were in the waiting area. We were initially okay with having no one there to greet us, however given that it was not a busy time and there were waitresses working in the kitchen literally a metre away from the entrance, I was starting to become peeved at not being welcomed.\n","\n","Atmosphere\n","Spacious but old decor. The restaurant was half full and relatively quiet, and I thought that the cleanliness can be overall improved. Washrooms weren't checked.\n","\n","The Food - Maki Rolls\n","As I'm pregnant, I have too many diet restrictions at a Japanese restaurant. I'm not sure how I've come this far into my pregnancy without having any sashimi or sushi! It's so difficult... as sashimi in Vancouver is truly one of the best. Anyway, so I settled for their Garden Roll (Yam tempura roll wrapped in Avocado and seaweed salad) and Philly roll (smoked salmon, cream cheese and cucumber) because they seemed somewhat unique (no more California rolls please!). I'm a fan of seaweed salad so I was looking forward to the Garden roll.\n","\n","The rolls themselves were just average quality; they weren't any different from my regular sushi joints near home and to be honest, they didn't seem worth the drive here. Husband wasn't a big fan of the Garden roll (he doesn't like seaweed salad), but it was alright in my books. The Philly roll tastes exactly the same as it would in other places. For the price, which is $ .  per roll, I would rather go to Sushi California or Sushi Garden for similar maki rolls.\n","\n","Chirashi \n","Husband decided to try their Chirashi don which is one of his go-to orders at Japanese restaurants. At $ . , we weren't too sure of what to expect. When it arrived, we were surprised at the size of his dish because it was rather small. Sure it was put in a deep dish, but it didn't seem like it had lots of sashimi in it.\n","\n","And we were right- there weren't a lot of sashimi in it. Half of it was rice (it's a Chirashi after all), but there was also lots of radish shavings in it to fill up extra space! Not impressed at all. We would've liked to have more seafood over rice, but given its price, that probably wasn't possible. But radish shavings! We did not pay to have that, and it didn't even look like decor.\n","In addition, there were only two pieces of salmon, one squid, one tuna, and others such as tako, tamago and masago. The quality of the fish was mediocre as well, especially the tuna! Hubby said it kind of smelled a bit off and that there was too much water coming from it - definitely not the freshest seafood around.\n","\n","Service\n","The servers were accurate and quick, but no extra friendliness, helpfulness, or polite-ness was given. It was the bare minimum and no one came to check on us throughout our dinner. Waitress came to take our order when we flagged her down, she came to our table to deliver our food, give us our cheque when asked and to later clear our dishes. I helped myself to our own receipt after payment as she wasn't around and I didn't want to wait any longer. We didn't really want to leave a nice tip because we had such a disappointing experience overall, but we gave the average  %.\n","I'm okay with getting minimal service at restaurants if they are busy, but when the restaurant is not, it was rather disappointing.\n","\n","Overall Verdict\n","At this point, we were pretty disappointed from our dinner and didn't understand why one would want to come here. I suppose the cheaper prices during the late nights were what attracts most people to the restaurant, and quite honestly, the quality of the food reflects the late night \"cheaper\" prices than the regular ones. Perhaps it was our fault for coming here during regular hours, but I'm actually glad I did because it provided us with a more accurate picture of the restaurant's quality.\n","\n","Would we recommend the place? No. We would actually recommend you to even skip the late night eats as you should prefer quality over quantity! For its cheap prices, you probably aren't getting the best quality of fish in the city. There are definitely better sushi restaurants (too many in Vancouver in all honesty) out there. Besides, parking can be difficult as the restaurant doesn't have very many spots.\n","DO NOT ORDER ANY BIRTHDAY CAKES FROM THIS LOCATION! it's unfortunate that the well-respected manager of   years decided to close up the other shop and transfer to this location. I believe the staff has changed or it is must be a completely different 'casual' staff on the weekends. I would give this place negative stars if I could as today proved the level of service has hit rock bottom and was truly abhorrent.  These young high school kids who work here need a real lesson in life, manners and the treating people in general with some respect. \n","It all started out with me picking up a birthday cake order for for my daughter's party. When the poker-faced cashier brought out the cake, I could not contain the disgust and cringed at the sight of this ghastly messy, poorly written slapped-together ice cream cake. As I pointed out the obvious to the cashier, Samir, she was less than helpful, barking back, rolling her eyes, scoffing at me telling ME there's nothing wrong with the cake!! The graphics were crooked with the piping overlapping the artwork, but the real kicker was the wording of the cake, Happy Birthday, 'name' and the ' '...WTF. I asked to have the cake fixed and corrected, told the staff exactly what should be done in the most time/cost effective way as time was of the essence. I sat there and waited...about   minutes later, the girl comes out to tell me, 'Sorry, your cake melted and there's nothing I can do.' WOW....I looked at my watch, it's been a HOUR and now we are going to be late for my daughters own birthday WITHOUT a cake?! How does a cake melt, while you are trying to fix it -- did you not put the cake in the freezer as this is an ice cream establishment? \n","I had to think fast so I just asked them to bring me the generic round cake(s) to feed our group, put the writing on it and be on our way. At this point, we were running late and I had wasted away an hour waiting for something which was further complicated by some incompetent, careless and disrespectful employee who decided to take this personally and as a result, ruin a child's birthday out of spite?!\n","After all of this, we finally got our round cakes and you'd think because they had screwed up so badly, they would comp us for the cake....NO. To add insult to injury, the employee called the manager on her day off  and I got on the phone with her. She insisted that I pay for the one cake....despite everything that has happened. To be clear, I would gladly have paid in full what I had ordered, however, they did not deliver to me what I requested. And now I was forced to take a different cake(s) and you insist that I pay for something I never ordered in the first place? Clearly this location and its management doesn't value customer service as the actions speak for themselves. \n","\n","Do yourself a favour...go to the Richmond Centre location to get a cake if you don't want to ruin your kid's birthday.\n","If I'm ever craving a decent katsu again, and I don't wanna travel far from home, then you will definitely find me back at Katsu San. It's tasty, close to home, and affordable!\n","\n","Stick around until the end of my review for my comparison between Katsu San and Saku (since a lot of people tend to compare these two and I'd like to weigh-in on that). Until then, I will be judging Katsu San solely for what it is and without comparing it to other katsu restaurants I have experienced.\n","\n","I decided to take myself on a date after finishing an  -hour work day, and remembered a few people mentioning this place to me, saying that it would be a good experience. Arriving at around  : , I was immediately seated without any wait time. The restaurant was fairly full, seating a total of roughly   people at maximum capacity, and boasting a welcoming, stylish, yet casual atmosphere. The staff were extremely polite, and service was consistent and happy throughout my dining experience.\n","\n","Moving on to the food, I have to say that, overall, I was very pleased at the quality of ingredients for the price you pay. Since it was my first time here, I opted for the assorted set (which came with one piece of ebi katsu, half of a pork katsu, and an order of the cheese katsu). Needless to say, my set came with the standard bowl of rice, cabbage salad, miso soup, and an assortment of various dipping sauces and ingredients for the different elements in my katsu set. \n","\n","While I felt as though the portion sizes could have been better, especially for a food-lover like me, for less than $ .  the presentation was excellent, and the ingredients in my entree worked harmoniously with each other as I worked my way around my set.\n","\n","During my meal, the thing that I had the most gripe with was the cold ramen. While the portion size seemed quite nice, I quickly found out that it's a lot of filler and not much substance. The soup broth was akin to sour water - acidic, a bit like vinegar, and lacking depth or any noticeable flavours. The noodles were much too chewy for my liking. While there are a lot of vegetables and half of a perfectly-soft-boiled egg, I could not recommend ordering the cold ramen to anyone. \n","\n","My experience with the $ .  cold ramen at Katsu San has resulted in me not being able to give this restaurant five stars. Had I not had the cold ramen and opted for another piece of katsu instead, I think I would have been much happier.\n","\n","Now, for what you've all been waiting for: is Katsu San similar to or better than Saku? In my opinion, Katsu San is on a similar level to Saku, but overall Saku is the clear winner in my opinon. Check out my review of Saku to see what I enjoyed so much about my experience there. The real kicker is that you get what you pay for at Saku - namely, the unlimited rice and salad. I also found that while Katsu San's pork is not greasy and is very tender, Saku's meat was more rich, in my personal opinion. I preferred the breading at Saku, although I must say that I did enjoy Katsu San very much and I appreciate, and believe, that their breading is made in-house daily!\n","\n","Let's just say that Katsu San is a fantastic option, and you get what you pay for. It's affordable luxury. At Saku, you also get what you pay for, and you get a little bit more luxury overall. There is nothing wrong with either, just depends what you're looking for I guess.\n","\n","All in all, Katsu San has you covered if you're looking for some good Japanese katsu in Richmond. Make no mistake, I will be back! Support this local business!\n","Finally got the chance to come here with my parents! \n","\n","The place was surprisingly packed on a Sunday afternoon for  ; we managed to get the last booth table. They've got some bigger tables in the middle of the place as well but the place was full the whole time we were there. If you don't mind sharing a table with others, you can have a shorter wait by sharing the table with others or it might be a while in order to get a two-person table or even the four seated booth seats. \n","\n","The menus are located at the side of the table (for the booth seats at least) where the tray of sauces are. They've got a menu booklet and then countless sheets of other menu items. There's only a few menus that had English on them so it might be hard to order here if you don't know how to read Chinese. Thankfully the infamous pineapple bun that I came for was on one of their translated English menus (so I was able to order on my own)! They've also got tons an tons of paper menus posted all around the restaurant as well but they are in Chinese so be sure to keep your eye out for them if you can read it and feel free to order from those as well. \n","\n","I ended up getting a noodle combo which came with a hot drink; since I wanted the pineapple bun with butter as well, I added that onto my combo which is slightly cheaper than ordering the bun by itself. My parents also got a noodle combo as well as a congee combo. For the congee combo, there are certain sides you can add on if you don't want a drink but some of the sides are only served before a certain time (ie. soy sauce noodles) so my mom had to opt for the Chinese donuts instead. Wouldn't recommend the Chinese donuts though as when her order came, there were only about half a stick of Chinese donuts on the side plate they gave her. \n","\n","The pineapple bun with butter was the last to come out. They make a tray at a time and distribute the fresh pineapple bun to it's customers. If you get the one with butter expect a little longer wait as they do that one after the plain one has been distributed and then they'll make other round for people who got the one with butter. \n","\n","Overall, the noodle and congee was ok for a Hong Kong cafe but the pineapple buns definitely live up to the hype. The buns are soft and warm that the slab of butter just melts inside the bun. The only down side to pineapple buns with butter is that I suggest you take out some of the butter first if you don't know how much butter you like as I found mine too salty and greasy but since all of it had melted into the bun already, I couldn't do much in terms of taking some butter off. The Hong Kong styled milk tea I got with the combo definitely complimented the bun very well. It was super filling with the bun and the noodles so I'd probably just get the bun and a drink the next time I'm around. \n","\n","My parents were curious about their dinner menu and desserts as well so it sounds like I'll definitely be back here in the future!\n","Richmond has lots of hidden jams in terms of the restaurants, this Japanese Place was definitely one of them. As my first impression was really good, but the second experience was such a turnoff. All happened in one week, which makes me feel a little disappointed on how quick the falloff is. \n","\n","When I went there on Tuesday for a work lunch with some coworkers, we put our names down for a table. The restaurant seemed to be very busy during lunch hours, and no reservation is allowed. Once we were seated, the waitress came and dropped off some tea and cups. As I was poring the tea, one of the cups burst into half which spilled all the water. I moved very quickly so the water didn't get on my pants. We joked about my tea poring skills afterwards, which I didn't think it was that big of a deal. But we tried for   minutes to flag down a waitress, and she only came to drop off more napkins, did not even take away the soaked ones, nor wiped down the table, very unlike the Japanese style. (I think they are not owned by actual Japanese that's why) \n","\n","When we got our food, I was impressed how fast they are with the orders, and how fresh the sashimi was. I ordered the spicy salmon sashimi combo, for only $ . ! It came with some cucumber rolls, diced salmon sashimi with spicy sauce, and some spicy salmon rolls. The salad and miso soup were also part of the combo, which I think was the best value. We were chatting and laughing, didn't really pay attention to the service etc, and didn't really care tbh. As long as the food was good right? \n","\n","On Saturday, I was in the neighborhood again and decided to do take out for our family. I bragged about the food with my husband who likes sushi very much, so I want him to try it. Because I had my baby daughter in the car, so I decided to call in to order first. The waitress on the phone was very impatient, and tried to hang up on my twice before I even finished my order! I had to keep telling her I'm not finished yet, and she didn't seem to care much.   mins later I went in to pick up the food with my daughter, it was busy as usual with a few people waiting outside, and nobody seem to know what's going on and no one at the door to seat people. I walked in and waited in line by the cashier and she saw me holding the baby, and still handed me a POS machine to pay and left me stood there. In my head, I was thinking how do you expect me to pay with both of my hand occupied, couldn't you just put it on the counter and let me know when it's ready? Once again, didn't seem to care. The funny thing is, the restaurant doesn't seem to be that busy to the point there's zero service to customers.\n","\n","I walked out with an annoying feeling, thinking if there's anyway they can improve their service. Because even though the food was good, the price was cheap, but they are not good enough for me to go back again having to deal with this type of service. So if any of you wants to eat inside, make sure to go early to avoid the wait. For pickup orders, please call in with a list of things telling them without breathing, so they wouldn't be able to hang up on you! Please don't have any expectations to their service because there is none.\n","I've had a lot of friends give me mixed reviews about Sanpoutei ramen. Some said it was a decent place to spend money on a meal while others have said they really just wasn't feeling it - that the noodles weren't the consistency they liked or the soup wasn't good. After waiting for a few years, I finally decided to try Sanpoutei out with a friend a few weeks back, so here I am now writing this review. \n","\n","Surely, if you're reading this review, you at least enjoy eating ramen, at various ramen places around metro Vancouver. Chances are, you probably know a thing or two about the process of making and ordering ramen, too! It's also very likely that you, with your understanding of this very niche part of Japanese cuisine, realize that no two ramen bowls from two different shops are created equal. Noodle thickness, chashu fattiness, broth consistency and flavour profile, extra toppings and their variations, etc. These are all variables that are modified and which vary from shop to shop which may or may not please the customer who, like all of us, have our preferences when it comes to what we like in a ramen bowl.\n","\n","Now, on to the actual food. I thought that the ramen here was actually quite nice and I don't remember thinking about anything bad about Sanpoutei. My friend and I both ordered the same, basic shio ramen, and we also ordered one side of chicken karaage to share. Our order came out of the kitchen piping hot and with the same plating as with any ramen shop, as expected. The portion size for the noodles were decent and I found my bowl of ramen to be quite filling. The chicken karaage was a tad bit on the small side and overpriced for the portion, but the batter was crispy and the chicken tasted fresh.\n","\n","The reason why I'm giving Sanpoutei a  -star is because I can't say anything really bad about it. The broth was full of flavour and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The meat wasn't cheap in terms of portion size and the toppings were all a cohesive part of the dish and blended well. Service was decent, but nothing overly impressive. One thing that really stood out to me was the atmosphere. As Google reads, Sanpoutei really is a nice modern eating establishment with Japanese accents. I'd imagine this would be a great place to just sit back and unwind after a hard day at work with some colleagues over bowls of ramen. \n","\n","All in all, I really can't think of anything bad about my experience at this place. It impressed me overall, and I'll probably be coming back again soon to try out some of their other menu items. If you haven't tried Sanpoutei ramen, I'd suggest trying it out yourself before making a judgement about it based on hearsay or others' experiences (unless you really trust your source)! Like every other ramen shop, there will be places you like and don't like, but it doesn't hurt to try something new every now and then.\n","Update: Jan    The page is closed for now.  However the restaurant is open for business!\n","Not sure what happened there.  I guess like myself and others, people thought they were out of business instead of renovating.\n","Good news! They're in business and these new owners from late   have cleaned up the old mess from the previous owners (less of that Seaside town smell) and they revamped their menu.  \n","\n","Check out my YouTube video for a more visual experience.\n"," \n","\n","Glad they kept their soups.  I like their Clam Chowder. I want to try their Corn Chowder.\n","\n","SAD, still no breakfast!!  This could be a gold mine for them.  I'm guessing the chef owner isn't very secure about making breakfasts.  \n","\n","OH and if you're wondering why I'm doing two reviews here?  Yelp closed the site so I can only edit the old one.\n","So here it is.\n","\n","I wanted the soup and ended up getting the Shrimp sandwich which comes with a soup for $  clams.  I was able to make it a clam/seafood chowder which I like here.\n","Fresh herbs, nice plump clams and potatoes and it's just the right amount of thickness.\n","The Shrimp Sandwich was very good too! I was quite surprised. I ate everything of course.  Very happy that the salad greens are fresh and the dressing was similar to a light Japanese style dressing.  After all the chef used to cook in a Japanese restaurant.\n","\n","Got the Cheese Herbed Oysters which caught us by surprise.  The oysters were actually a decent size.  Why bother getting that chintzy Oyster Motoyaki from next door when I can have this!!  One downside was that the spinach made it a bit watery (or maybe it was white wine?) but still, in comparison to next door and other places that serve a dish similar to this, The Cannery is much much better!  \n","\n","Now I can't wait to try this place for a dinner.  More to come when Yelp changes the status from closed to open. \n","\n","And again, if you want to see my video of our experience, click on here for Lala_eats_stuff.\n"," \n","\n","Old review - October  \n","\n","I have really wanted to like this place and I've seen restaraunteurs come and sadly go because they didn't understand what the community wanted in their food.  Just recently a month ago they got new people in here cooking new menu items.  The food is a bit more polished and the place has a rustic renovated look compared to a few years ago, but there is more attention to detail that needs to be looked into.  \n","The first thing is the smell.  It smells like an old net loft and for this town, that was ok   years ago but not today.  It's always smelled like this.  It must be the Cannery Cafe smell?  \n","\n","But wait!  I have good news!  The clam chowder is very good! Freshly made lots of herbs and spices to compliment the clam flavour.  I would think this is one of the better chowders in town.  Give it a try just for that and be your own judge. \n","\n","The chef here had worked in a Japanese restaurant so you'll notice some Japanese inspired dishes like tonkatsu sandwich and pumpkin soup.  But everyone who comes here is thinking and wanting Breakfast Grub.  Like omelettes and bacon n eggs or pancakes.  Food coffee and a side of sausages.  Heck the chef cooked Japanese food for so many years why not offer Japanese Style breakfast?  This town was known for its Japanese fisherman why not an ode to that?\n","\n","Salted salmon with Soya sauce on rice topped with a fried egg.  Yummy.  I can just imagine that.  \n","\n","But that's not what they make. \n","\n","They do have a breakfast menu, albeit small and probably healthier too.  Not quite the stick to your ribs breakfast.\n","\n","I ordered a breakfast sandwich in a toasted ciabatta bun.  It came with a salad and I ordered a small coffee with it. \n","\n","I think I'll come again.  I heard all those customers that walked in, sat down and then left after mentioning they didn't see the breakfast items they wanted.  The waitress seemed a bit sad.  \n","Hopefully the chef will look into cooking what the people want.  Which is why I want to come back.  I want to see if it will change and become the place I want to visit each weekend.  \n","So this means we'll be back :)\n","Had an awful experience at the Richmond location. Food was good though. But will not be returning.\n","\n","We arrived for dinner at   we were seated in the restaurant area. We ordered dinner and some drinks. We were enjoying ourselves and chatting. We did enjoy the food. One of my friends was telling us about a death in their family and how hard things had been lately.\n","At about  :  the server came and put the bill face down on the table with the desert menu and did not say anything. We continued to chat and I had decided that I would order a dessert. Then at   the server came by and said how would you like to pay. My friend said that we were not ready yet. The server just walked away.   minutes later an individual in dressy black jogging pants and white top came to the table and said  with an arrogant attitude that they were really sorry but that they had a reservation coming in and needed the spot.\n","When I looked around the restaurant there were other empty tables. We felt like we were being kicked out as we had not ordered anything more but we were never given the chance.\n","If it had been a Friday or Saturday night or even if we were downtown we would have understood or if the hostess had said that there is a time limit tonight because we have been busy we would have understood, but it was a TUESDAY NIGHT in RICHMOND (sorry don't believe that you guys are that busy).\n","In addition, I do not understand that if the table was needed that badly then why could the server have not said that, and instead ran to the manager....think the server needs a little more training.\n","So this is where things went further south...\n","As we were getting ready to leave, as a hostess kept standing near the table while we were paying (I wish I never left a tip as the service received did not warrant it). I asked the hostess who was standing there what the name of the manager for the restaurant was as I was planning to provide feedback just to them. The hostess with wavy long black hair, south Asian and braces and short with attitude said \"I don't know\". I looked at her and said you don't know...she gave me a snarky response saying that they are new and walked away. The next thing the individual in the black jogger pants and white top and blond hair and her were walking away together whispering.\n","I then asked another hostess  who was Asian clearing a table what the name of the restaurant manager was and she provided me this information. She then asked if there was something that they could help with. I said no as I was pretty pissed off (hope you can tell from this letter) that I had decided I would just write to you.\n","As we were just outside the door, a manager Amanda came out. I told her not worry I would be writing head office. She wanted to listen so we explained the above situation. She did apologize but I am sorry  it was too late.\n","She offered next time we could come in and call or e-mail her that we are coming and we could get appetizers. This was a nice suggestion, however I don't think we had much interest in returning to your restaurant  any time soon. My friend asked for a gift certificate and then Amanda stated that they would need to mail us these. She did take my name and address. I just cannot believe that your managers can not even resolve an issue like this at that level. Simply offering a discount off our bill could have provided a gentle delivery about apologizing  for our experience. \n"," \n","I contacted head office they told me they had a two hour limit and it is on their online reservation. Thing is we were a walk in. Emily from head office was also very rude on the phone and did not handle the situation at all.\n","They need to work on customer service!!!\n","I have never left HaiDiLao unhappy or unsatisfied. The SERVICE parallels that of fine dining restaurants, and the food quality is very good. I've heard about the long wait times, but by the time I get to Vancouver, it's past the dinner rush. So, although they are busy, I've never had to wait for a table. There are massage chairs in the waiting area that I have not used, but it's a nice touch.They have built in drawers in the seats so you can store your coat, and they provide hair ties for the ladies if your hair is down, and you're trying to feast. It's the little things!\n","\n","My favorite soup base has got to be tomato, but the pork bone broth is a close second.  If you want to eat the meat off the pork bone, they also provide gloves to hold the bone and a straw to suck the marrow. You can choose up to   broths, which will aid in accommodating all flavor preferences in your party.\n","\n","HaiDiLao is most famous for their noodle twirling show, and it never disappoints. Also a plus that the end product to the show is perfectly uniform, chewy noodles. Recommend ordering the hand pulled noodles, especially if it is your first time.\n","\n","In terms or variety, there are many exotic offerings. If you order the lamb brain, which I do recommend, they make a traditional dry spice blend for you to dip it in, and it makes all the difference.\n","\n","The first time I went, I ordered prime beef rib, which seemed pricey for what it was. Since then, I just order the beef brisket and feel it is just as good for a fraction of the price.\n","\n","Huge fan of the cuttlefish paste, shrimp paste, and the ball sampler. The seafood in general is very fresh. \n","\n","Yes, you have to pay for the sauce bar per person, but it is always clean and stocked with everything under the sun to make all the sauces of your dreams.\n","\n","Here are some things I would skip: \n","- Egg fried rice - Lackluster.. might as well be eating plain white rice. Basically, only order if you need rice.\n","- Fried durian - Just ok. It is fried well, and would not be on this list if there was real durian meat in the center. Alas, it was a very sweet durian thick sauce and not worth filling your belly when there are so many other good things to eat.\n","- Osmanthus (?) - No, not the plant. It is some sort of seafood that comes rolled in a flat circle, but when unrolled, it's like tripe. \n"," \n","I wish they had better combo sets since I'm not a fan of items like luncheon meat. Ordering a la carte works for me. The last time I went, I also only saw chive (vegetarian) dumplings on the menu. I love dumplings with my hot pot and would prefer a pork and chive dumpling - personal preference, but the chive dumplings almost made the skip list.\n","\n","While, the interior of the restaurant is not as fancy as other chains like Dolar Shop, it is spacious, clean and comfortable. HDL is my all time favorite hot pot spot, and in my opinion, worth every penny.\n","My first visit tonight was extraordinary! Date night:\n","\n","We ordered from the Wagyu beef menu (for  ) tonight and let me tell you, if you are a beef enthusiast, or even just a foody, this was an out-of-this-world experience! Of course, because of the richness of the Wagyu and its fat content, you can only have a small portion ( -  bite sized morsels), but boy was it ever worth it! Word of warning - savour it, chew it and really taste it! Don't waste it! It literally melts in your mouth, no matter the done-ness. Seasoned perfectly and just felt/tasted like beefy butter. I had mine done rare, and my boyfriend went with medium; they both tasted very similar in terms of texture and flavour - very delicious and you almost can't even tell the difference between the two. It was my first time having Wagyu too and we were not disappointed in the slightest.\n","\n","The meal also came with an appetizer sushi plate (  pieces of salmon sashimi,   aburi sushi -   pcs of   different kinds,   was chewy with kelp on top and the other was a crispy one),   scallops,   chunks of cod, veggie stir-fry (zucchini, onions, mushrooms), fried rice and stir-fried beansprouts.\n","\n","The appetizer sushi plate was tasty; the crispy one though, I wasn't a huge fan of but that could have just been personal preference. The scallops weren't done perfectly (a tad undone), but they were still good and tasty. The portions were good (I saw some reviews of people complaining about the portions - there was plenty!) The veggies and rice ended up tasting really good mixed with the ginger sauce they give you in a little dish with teriyaki sauce on the other side.\n","\n","I've been to numerous teppanyaki places before, and would have liked to see this place clean their grills the way I see the other restaurants do... When we sat down, it was dirtier than I am used to (it's usually spotlessly clean elsewhere and ready for the cook start with a quick wipe down with a clean wet towel), and they did clean it before the cook started while we had been seated for at least  - , but I would have preferred it to have been spotless before I sat down, so that it wasn't getting potentially splashed onto the appetizer plate that was being eaten while they were cleaning the grill with splashy wet soppy methods (this was the only part I took a star off for). The splashy wet soppy mess clean-up usually happens at the end...\n","\n","In summary, the food is amazing here - come here if you want high quality Wagyu beef and a really good flavour profile in a multiple course meal with variety - everything that is grilled is seasoned very perfectly tasty! The service was also very friendly and the environment was comfortable and colourful - I loved the interior style and the choice to have a regular Japanese meal as well without the teppanyaki (the menu looked like they had a lot of high quality sushi and sashimi too and would love to try it out the next time I am here! However, it's hard not to want the tasty teppanyaki when you come in though!)\n","The first time I was here was summer  , I was not really sure what to eat in the area. So me and my friend decided to choose the restaurant with the longest line up. At the time, it was Ramen Izakaya. We waited for about half an hour to get a table and had the best dinner ever. \n","\n","Ever since then, I have been going to this place a lot. I dine here at least five times a month. And since I'm a person who is scared to try new things, I always order the same thing, Tan Tan Noodle with extra noodle. For side dish, is either the fried oysters or the Chicken Karaage. It's safe to say that I am a regular at this place. I have been here with my girlfriend, my parents, and a lot of my friends. It is my favorite restaurant in the Lower Mainland. I live in Burnaby right now sometimes I would drive all the way to Richmond just to eat here. After I move to Port Moody I will still do the same.\n","\n","Since I always order the same thing, I guess I will talk about the Tan Tan noodle only. When the dish is brought before your eyes, it has a stunning presentation. I love the way they have everything laid out so perfect in the bowl; certainly looks like it was made with love and care, just like how mom would make it for me. Moving onto the taste part; as soon as I put my chopsticks inside the soup to stir it, my hands will feel that this soup is really something. I like how they put peanut butter into the soup to make it really thick, and the peanut butter also makes an excellent scent. For the noodles, it is almost like the noodles you would get from packaged ramen, but it has so much more fun in them. They are hard noodles, so they give a really good feel when I am chewing them. The vegetables inside the bowl are very fresh; and the pork chops... Man, they are out of this world! After all, the Tan Tan Noodle is the best noodle I have ever eaten in my life. \n","\n","The service at the restaurant is excellent as well. The waitresses are really friendly and hardworking: the cooks really look like they can cook good food even with their eyes closed. Every employee hired is Japanese; some of them might not speak good English, but I think That what makes it better about this place. For a ramen restaurant, the feel of yourself in Japan is really important, and they have done a fatanstic job on that. All the decors and posters inside the restaurant are either in Japanese or involved with Japanese culture. In conclusion about the service and environment of this place, my water cup is never empty and a cheap and cheat way to be in Japan.\n","\n","Ramen Izakaya @ Nan chuu, a place where I will never stop going unless it closes.\n","A friend recommended me to try out Teppen kitchen so i decided to try it for dinner.\n","There are   equally delicious-looking dishes available, which, for a first timer, can be overwhelming. After a couple minutes of deciding, I ordered the \"A grade rib eye beef teppan rice\" because I was told it was ordered often and it sounded tasty to me. Cook time took about  -  minutes which is a little slower than I thought it would take. At the time there were about   or   customers ahead of me, so it's understandable. Some of the other customers ordered the same dish as me in fact.\n","I opted for the combo which includes a choice of drink and miso soup for only $ .  more which i think is worth it. I got the milk tea. I also added   extra toppings of cheese and egg for $ .  each. \n","When the dish arrived, I thought it looked delicious with the food still sizzling on a hot iron plate. The food on the plate was arranged so the beef forms a circle and a mound of rice with a brown sauce in the middle. The egg was put in the corner and the shredded cheese was sprinkled on the top of the rice mound.\n","As for taste, the dish was surprisingly bland as a whole unless you put a lot of the provided sauces. I added several small cups worth of a thick flavored broth and the chipotle flavored sauce that are available at the front of the stand. (They also have a bottle of Sriracha chili sauce if you like spicy stuff.) The dish tasted much better after I added the sauces.\n","The  egg was still crispy by the time I ate it and added a little more flavor to it.  The shredded cheese barely added any taste to the dish. The beef was alright based on taste. They could add more seasoning on it. The beef was rather more pink than i thought it would be but I assume that is what medium rare beef looks like in contrast to the dark colored plate. The miso soup and the Milk tea tasted alright. Portion wise, as a whole, they could a little more toppings for a $ + dish. I appreciate they give you a hot plate instead of styrofoam plates you get at many food courts. The hot plate kept my meal hot the entire time and it looks good on the table for those instagram likes.  \n","All in all, It's really not a bad value for $ - . You might have to put a  lot of their sauces at the front if you want more taste otherwise it could be a little bland like mine did. Because I got the combo, the addition of the large drink and miso soup after the large plate of food makes you pretty full at the end.\n","I planned on having bubble tea later but canceled it because I was already full. If you are a fast eater, don't drink too fast afterwards or you'll have a bad time with your digestion. (Trust me on this.) \n","I'll try another of their   other dishes someday the next time i'm at Aberdeen centre for a meal.  . /  rounded up to  .\n","First off let me state my   star review is based on the service(lack of) received by on duty manager and the washroom facilities available(again lack of). The food, servers, and atmosphere are your typical Cactus Club fare, very adequate.\n","\n","I have visited this new location   times including this most recent visit I am basing my   star review on. The first two times were OK, couple hiccups but nothing major. This last visit( / / ) is the one that will likely keep me from returning to this location.\n","\n","My party of two arrived approximately  . We were seated in the solarium section. Ordered truffle fries to start, and a couple beverages. A few moments later I went to use the washroom, was pretty shocked to see only two urinals and ONE stall(yes, just one). The stall was occupied(no surprise). I exited the bathroom... No big deal I can use the family washroom as it was listed as \"vacant\" but wait it is locked. I return to my table, finish our appetizer and drink, still baffled that only one stall is available in the men's washroom. I go once more to the washroom and no surprise the lone stall is occupied. Upon exiting I try the family washroom once more - still vacant yet locked. I FYI'd staff about this. they are just standing around chatting. I return to my table extremely frustrated once again.\n","\n","I asked the server(who was great btw) the next time she visited our table(which was frequent) if I could speak to a Manager, to which she said of course. A few moments later a Manager arrived, I do not recall her name but she was a tall, slender, blonde woman. I explained the situation to her and that I find it pretty absurd that they only have one stall in the men's washroom and that I tried to use the family washroom twice yet it was locked. She agreed with me that she has no idea why there is only one stall in the men's bathroom, and that the family bathroom is locked  -  and only a fob can open it - \"so people don't use it\". Should someone need to use they are to get a Manager to fob them into the washroom.... This is indicated nowhere on signage around the washrooms.\n","\n","I did not understand why only one stall was in the men's bathroom, I now wondered why fob access is required for the family bathroom. It is rather inconvenient for a mother with child, a handicap individual, someone who likes privacy, or should the lone men's stall be out of order - have to ask staff to fob them in, like children; not to mention nobody knows this as this is not written anywhere in the building! The manager apologized and said she can fob me in should I like, or at a later time - I declined as my frustration trumped my need to go at this point. I indicated to the Manager this would likely be a determining factor in ever returning to this location. She merely apologized as per usual manager protocol and left.\n","\n","I did at a later point finally use the bathroom, the lone stall in the men's room. It was already out of one roll of toilet paper. Some guy literally just walked out of it as I entered(lucky me), for hygienic reasons alone there should be two stalls minimum(byrne road at least has  !). I asked my GF how many stalls the women's washroom had she replied several, I think   w/handicap. Even the two urinals is not sufficient in the men's, there was often a crowd and line-up, the bathroom is tiny, almost claustrophobic.\n","\n","I saw the Manager I spoke with at least half-dozen times throughout the night, in my section, often at tables within feet from me. She made no contact, and did not follow up even once to see how the rest of our evening was. I get the impression she simply did not care, she did the bare minimum and that was it. We received no comp on our meal, not even a round of drinks, nothing! I didn't ask but considering my meal was constantly interrupted by having to use(try-to) their insufficient washroom facilities it was a waste of my time and money. Hard to enjoy a meal when you are getting up to win the bathroom lottery every so often.\n","\n","Our bill was $ (before tip), yes we still tipped, it was not the servers/cooks fault. The way the Manager handled this was not ideal. I know she cannot physically renovate the washroom but she could have done a lot more... she did not even follow-up with us after her lone visit, pitiful.\n","\n","To summarize we ordered truffle fries, jambalaya rice bowl, kobe meat ball-duo w/extra meatball, two glasses of white,   double rum/coke, cheese cake.\n","\n","I have attached a photo of the washroom. For an establishment that is trying hard for the ultra-cool-luxe-premiumesque-lounge-look this washroom is a huge fail. Not to mention this place is big, their max occupancy has to be at least   minimum, did they not think more than one patron may require use of a stall at the same time?\n","\n","I have never experienced this at any other cactus club location, or any problems for that matter. Baffling how such a design flaw could have been made from the get-go; worse that managers can't handle situations adaquetly.\n","Knowing that this is a popular cafe & restaurant in Taiwan I was itching to try it out ever since it first opened in Taipei. I've been following the boss lady (twin sister & brother business) on Instagram right from the beginning due to my own interest in baking & desserts so I was more than interested in trying out this cafe. I only had one worry: their service.  Solely because cafe's and restaurants with a lot of hype and publicity through the general public and celebrities can be a hit and miss. \n","\n","I made reservations about   weeks prior and like most reviewers, I called several times without anyone picking up. Annoyed but not surprised. How I got the reservation was by calling right when they closed at  . Yes! Call at   or later! I had questions a few days later & called twice during business hours (no answer) and finally got a lady to pick up after   rings at  :  and another day at  :  after   ring. \n","This is what I was told by the lady on the phone:   minute sitting time. Cash & credit are both accepted. Groups of  + are subject to  % tax.\n","All of them sounded very nice and pleasant on the phone. \n","\n","Let's start with what went well today.\n","\n","Our party of   arrived for a quiet and simple birthday/bachelorette party and we were seated promptly in the middle of the cafe. It was obviously not the best spot because it was a little loud but I thought, whatever, I can't complain because I hadn't thought about reserving a table in the corner. I don't know if it was because they noticed it was a special event or because I brought some balloons -   reg size with helium &   small latex ones (placed on the table) when another waitress kindly told us they'd be moving us to a corner table which is a little more quiet, more spacious and had chairs with rabbit ears (my friend would enjoy that). I thought it was very nice of them. \n","The waiters and waitresses were very courteous and removed our finished plates/dishes in a timely manner, refiled out water every so often. Bonus! Who doesn't love that?\n","Our orders arrived quite promptly and the girls enjoyed their drinks and food. I personally wasn't expecting a wow factor in taste based on other reviews I've read but it was still relatively good tasting.\n","I brought my own candles & lighter and asked if they'd be able to put it on the dessert. No problem they said. \n","\n","Now, on to the unpleasant & very unhappy end to the party (at least for me) \n","\n","One girl ordered the seafood pasta which arrived last. She returned it right away to their kitchen because it was the wrong order. I couldn't see clearly from where I was sitting but the girl said it looked like chicken, not seafood. You'd think the waiter who took it back would check the dish and come back to tell us if it indeed was the correct/wrong order or that a new pasta will be arriving soon. Nope! Nothing for the next   minutes (at least!). She finally waved down a waiter and asked, \"where did my pasta go?\" He apologized and said he didn't know but he'll double check. A waitress came by with the order list confirming the dish she ordered and left. During this whole time, both waiter and waitress looked perplexed. The same waiter came back a few minutes later telling her they're going to make it now. WHAT?! What are you going to do? Say no, I'm not eating after you've been sitting there over an hour since you arrived? \n","After another waiting period, her food finally arrived and yes, she confirmed the dish looked different because she saw scallop and shrimp. By this time the rest of us were eating dessert. \n","Paying the bill is another issue. The bill arrived with all our orders on it. Ok, that's fine because a lot of restaurants do this. I had my credit card out and told the waitress we'll pay individually according to what we ordered. She said, \"we cannot split the bill\". WHAT?! Another girl of our party said a waiter allowed herself and another girl to split the order earlier because that girl had to leave first; therefore, they paid their portion.  Perhaps they could pay because the rest of us hadn't placed our order yet? I didn't bother asking. Anyhow, the waitress looked perplexed and said she'll double check. A different waiter came by to tell us \"we informed you upon your arrival that we cannot split bills\".  NO ONE told me at any point in time that they CANNOT NOT SPLIT THE BILL. I didn't want to argue at this point because all I wanted to do is to leave asap. Never have I encountered a restaurant who doesn't allow customers to split the bill. I've been to some that won't split the bill individually by customer but NOT a restaurant that doesn't allow customers to pay individually. This is ridiculous! Am I understanding something wrong? We all paid by cash in the end, but what's the difference in that? \n","Someone pls clarify this to me!\n","\n","The bottom line is: I will not return to this cafe in Richmond or any of their chain restaurants in Asia. Nor do I recommend Dazzling Cafe to any of my friends.\n","This just doesn't do it for me, really, no, I was thinking   but as the rating goes, I have experienced better, Hawaii would be one, and now in Seattle would definitely be another. I was awed, wowed, my hopes and prayers were lifted that a true fresh udon joint was to hit the GVR and my cravings would be met, I came in with great hope and left with a puzzled look.\n","\n","Coming into this mall, where the food court once was, and the theatre of yesteryear once stood, now there is an escalator to the 'Terrace' to a very pretty display of food vendors and a great place to eat. Craving for the notorious thick Japanese noodle, and living in the memory of my vacation in Waikiki and Murakami (look it up, and you will know udon) so coming here I had expectations. This city and the trend has been to ramen so it's hard to find any fresh 'made-on-the-spot' udon joint anywhere and when I heard of this I was just waiting to strike. Coming here with my dear, we made two orders, hers was a hot soup based one (nabeyaki) and mine one of the cold udon (Zaru) dishes with some sauce. It's amazing how different heat can make udon, if you don't believe me, try two bowls and take a bite!\n","\n","The excitement wore off when we got our food and sat down to eat, it looked good, but the bite was off. Starting with the hot one, I think I've eaten udon too many years of my life, from restaurants to food courts, to that nice vacuum sealed mini square packaged cheap stuff at the grocery store to the frozen   flat that is a bit more expensive I have seen it all and this fresh udon in the hot broth was below the standards of the cheap   cent vacuum sealed pack. Lacking bite and life it was like the noodles were sitting in water a little too long where if it sat in the soup any longer I'd be scared it would disintegrate into mush. I remembered that my dear ordered a nabeyaki udon, I remember everywhere this dish is ordered, usually there is fish cake, where is my mysterious fish that is mashed up into cool colorful cake??? \n","\n","My Zaru udon was a lot better than the hot soup based one my dear had, the noodles did not lose their bounce, their bite, and their thickness as if you compared the two noodles you would have thought you were eating a completely different product. Each of the dishes came with a variation of fried things. Mine came with some chicken karaage, and my partner's dish came with some tempura shrimp and vegetables. Something tells me that they were under a heat lamp a little too long.... if you have had fresh from the fryer tempura you will understand.\n","\n","Your probably asking me \"what the hell, it is food court fast food\", and here's my comeback on you. Go up to the Terrace, take a look at how much real-estate this place takes up in the food court, they aren't lacking in preparation space compared to a tiny food stand we are used to seeing in another food court, they practically have restaurant room here. I will give them props for the pager they give you to hold and to come back once your order is complete. They have cool seating with the green coming off their big sign to give you a zen lke feel. In the end it's about the product, and comparing to Hawaii, and now, recently, in Seattle, those places are practically fast food joints and know how to produce udon, quick, fast cheap and good, with all the side fixings. I can see your making these noodles from scratch but you can't trick me in what real good udon taste like!\n","This was the first restaurant my boyfriend and I went to on our date. Haha :$ \n","But basically this place is one of our go to restaurants for sentimental reasons and because they have pretty decent Taiwanese food with an average price. BUT... \n","\n","Why the one star? \n","Where do I even begin. \n","They've changed the menu and increased the price by a lot. The \"set meal menu\" shows an average price of $ .  \n","So my boyfriend and I figured our meal would come out to be $ \n","DO NOT BE FOOLED. \n","Look at the small print. They charge $ .  for a small bowl of white rice and a bit of veggies. A meal in the set meal is $ + \n","Imagine our surprise when the bill came go be $ + \n","\n","Besides the increase in price-which irritated me because it was SO misleading. \n","The customer service SUCKED. \n","\n","We normally go when it's busy and today we went for lunch on a Tuesday. \n","There were   waitresses and   other tables besides us. So it was really dead. \n","We asked for hot water because we didn't feel like a bubble tea. The cup was really small and we finished the water in a couple sips. THROUGHOUT the whole meal which lasted about  .  hrs (ill tell you why in a bit) they didn't offer us a refill- EVEN THOUGH he hinted how thirsty he was at the waitress and flipped his cup over. The waitresses also creepily stare at you throughout the meal which I find very awkward and uncomfortable. It's like they were trying to be attentive but yet they weren't doing anything to serve us. \n","He was really annoyed and ticked they weren't doing their job. The only thing they did was take our order and bring us the food. \n","\n","Now let me tell you why we ate lunch for an hour and a half. \n","Normally we finish our lunch in   mins...   hour max. As it's just to grab a bite to eat. \n","My boyfriend got his order fairly quickly, within   mins, but I however did not. \n","I thought maybe mine was harder to make so I waited. And keep in mind I get super grumpy when I'm hungry... So I snacked on HIS food in the meantime. I waited and waited. A dish came out and I thought it was mine so I got excited. And guess what? It was for another table. Which might I add ordered   minutes after us. \n","\n","Obviously up to that point I thought they might have forgotten to put my order in (I was right) and I ask the waitress how much longer will my food be. She told me she'll check on the food. Took a while, she ended up talking to the kitchen and other people about my food. Turns out she didn't order it as I overheard. Came back and didn't tell me, instead she told me to wait another   minutes. \n","\n","Sigh. Well basically after not getting my food and being all grumpy. And getting the bill which surprised me...Know that they lost two loyal customers. \n","My boyfriend and I will not be going back here for sure.\n","No, my Sat-Nav didn't break down.  I really did drive to Richmond, BC, or as some people call it...\n","\n","...well, I could insert an Asian joke about this point, but I really have no issues with the ethnic mix of this region of Canada, especially considering that I inadvertently stumbled into the last bastion harboring the city's white community, a walled enclave called Country Meadows Golf Course.  I wouldn't normally have turned in except for the signs insisting that anyone was welcome to eat at their restaurant, The Grille.  Not the most original name.  My navigator was directing me to pass the location, to soldier onto my ultimate destination, the Colossus Cineplex.  However, despite being surrounded by a multitude of stores, I found not one place to eat there.  With over an hour before the showing, I turned the car around and made back for Country Meadows. \n","\n","It is a beautiful place, an island of immodesty in an ocean of unharvested plywood.  There's a rutting dark bull frozen in pose before the entrance.  I'm the only one looking up at the architecture as families, elderly couples, and businessmen shuffle past glaring at me like I'm an Asian at an all-white country club.  In honesty, I do spot a few here and there, but with  % of Richmond being minority (yea that makes sense), this tastes as being a little unrepresentative of the city's demographic.  I wander in and am broadsided at the quality of workmanship inside.  It blends that bizarre aristocratic country sensibility, the kind where people welcome you into their home and end up showing off the wood in the bar, with those antique family restaurants that continue so survive against the onslaught of franchise mediocrity.  Most of the main floor is dominated by an empty stage, one which I knew would puncture my ear drums if occupied.  \n","\n","But this isn't a family restaurant, not exactly.  It's a strange melange of family and fine dining with a mix of pub thrown in for good measure, like it changes its definition depending on the day of the week or the time of day.  The waitress offered a menu but immediately sold me on the soup sandwich special for the day, costing a mere twelve bucks.  With it, you also receive a glass of cola so tall, that it casts a shadow like a Kubrikian monolith over the rest of the meal.  The sandwich was a massive bun shoehorned with meat and melted cheese and was the best I may have ever tried in a restaurant environment.  \n","\n","Boy, do I know how to call them.  Even though I was thirsty, I had no capacity to finish my drink, this Burj Khalifa-sized coke with an undertow.  The service was great; the food was better, and now I feel bad given my arrogant remarks at the beginning.  The only time I ever golfed, my twelve-year old nephew beat me, and I've never been able to hit a ball more than   yards in my life, and only then, it was a simulation golf course where you smack a ball to a projection twenty feet away from the tee.  I don't care for the game and find it boring and unnecessary, sorry to all my Scottish friends out there...yes, I realize that I have no Scottish friends. \n","\n","However, this should not detract you from trying the Grille Restaurant at Country Meadows if you happen to be driving to the Colossus and realize you have an hour to kill.  This may be the only circumstance I can think of...I sure can't think of another reason to be there.  \n","\n","Food:   / \n","Service:   / \n","Presentation:   / \n","Value:   / \n","Recommendation:   . / \n","I went on their   day of business last week (April  ) around   for my birthday.\n","\n","The   of us went in knowing that crawfish didn't have much meat, but we ordered   lbs to try it out anyway.  We got it with medium spiced Big Easy sauce, which is a mixture of Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter.  I think this is definitely the sauce to get.  Medium spice is just about right.  We found it wasn't too spicy but it still managed to make us cough from time to time.  I honestly don't have a baseline for seafood boils, so my bar was low.  I understand that some places have thick sauce but even though their sauce might not be authentic, it's really quite terrific.  I enjoyed the hell out of the sauce.  It was a big highlight for us.  It's buttery, oily and has a little bit of kick to it.  It's a great compliment to the seafood.\n","\n","As for the experience, you get a your order of seafood marinating in sauce and it's served in a clear plastic bag and a bucket.  Nothing fancy.  You put on a bib, and you eat with your hands.  It's messy, but it's awesome.  If you're a prissy eater, you can ask them for latex gloves, but I think you're doing yourself a disservice by eating that way.  Have at it and get all   digits dirty.  If you don't like the way I'm describing this, then you're probably not going to enjoy the food.  \n","\n","We killed off the crawfish and moved onto shrimp.  We ended up order   and then another   right after.  The shrimp is awesome.  They're pretty big and quite meaty.  I'd recommend getting shrimp.  It's way better value, easier to eat, and super awesome with the sauce.  I keep going back to that sauce.  Peel the shrimp and dip it right back into the bag.  Don't be shy.  Otherwise, you're wasting the sauce.  We ordered bread too.  The bread is kinda disappointing cause it's kind of cold and hard.  If they had some softer bread or if it came out a little bit toasted, it would be   better.  Maybe they will change that one day.  Regardless, the bread is a great vessel for soaking up the sauce, and it's a good filler too.\n","\n","We also ordered the Gumbo with rice as well as an order of Calamari.  The gumbo wasn't too bad.  I thought it was tasty.  It was a good starter.  We asked the staff for bowls and we got extra spoons and bowls to split the large order of gumbo.  They were nice about it and didn't give us any grief.  The calamari was different.  They resembled BK onion rings.  Texture-wise, I thought they were OK.  The cocktail and tartar sauces were actually quite good and I felt they saved the dish.\n","\n","They don't have a lot of the beers listed on their menu (yet, I hope).  It's kinda strange that they have beer bottles displayed in their decor, but half of them aren't really in stock or on their menu.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they are brand new.  I expect things to be imperfect, and a lack of beer selection is hardly a reason to knock them.\n","\n","Service-wise, everyone was very nice.  I'm not sure if they actually separate servers by section/tables cause it seemed like we had a couple people serving us.  I thought service was pretty good for day  .  I didn't have any major issues with how we were treated or the wait times.  I'd say that the restaurant was about  % full.  There wasn't any hot water in the restrooms so before we left, we suggested that they look into that.  It's hard to wash oily hands with cold water.  And sure enough, that was resolved the next day, cause I went back with more friends the next night.  So that should tell you what I really thought of the place.  I'll follow-up with another write up for the   experience.\n","\n","In conclusion, you're probably going to spend $ +.  We didn't get crab or lobster and that surely would have pushed us into the $ /person range.  I don't think the prices were that outrageous.  It's all seafood and I think the food is pretty good.  I'm going to give Crawfish King a solid   stars.  If they work out the minor kinks, then I think it probably gets   stars.  The service was pretty good that night and for a brand new restaurant, I thought it was even more impressive.  I would not confuse a slow kitchen as bad service with the front-of-house staff.\n","* What an improvement! *\n","\n","While I mostly enjoy flying Cathay Pacific, the YVR lounge was always a bit of a letdown compared to the other lounges in their network. It had that same old tired steamer of   types of dim sum, a few mediocre sandwiches and low quality snack food.  It had a separated space for first class from the business class, and all that added was slightly better alcohol and a few snack options. Not a big difference at all.\n","\n","Those times are done.  Cathay closed that old lounge and has opened this new one in a different location. They built on the   floor between gates   and  , and built a space that is a smaller version of their better quality lounges you find in many airports in Asia. \n","\n","They no longer pretend to separate business and first class, and instead have opted to make a larger space with higher quality offerings for all. The highlight is by far the noodle bar, which is quite similar to the one in the Hong Kong airport business class lounge (they haven't gone as far as to do the full sit down table service and private cabanas like the HK first class lounge, but considering this is a remote station for them that seems just fine).  \n","\n","They offer three varieties of noodle soup:  wonton, dan dan, and fish ball which are all prepared fresh after you order. They also had a variety of dim sum on the menu that you could also order to be prepared fresh instead of just sitting in a steamer over steaming. I ordered the dan dan noodles, which is prepare entirely vegetarian.  After ordering they give you a beeper to let you know when your soup is ready.  \n","\n","The soup was presented in a classic styled bowl. The noodles were surprisingly good - toothsome in fact.  The broth had the classic peanut, sesame and chili balance and really satisfied. They offer chili oil on the side to increase the heat to your comfort level. (I tend to go less hot when flying, so it was appreciated to have the flexibility.) What an improvement over the food choices they used to have in their old lounge back near the international security entrance.  \n","\n","The other soup option available in the international terminal is the Plaza Premium lounge which does freshly prepare fish noodle soup, but I have to say the quality of the soup and noodles here at the Cathay lounge are MUCH better.\n","\n","They also have a small buffet set up outside of the noodle bar where you can grab a variety of sandwiches, meats and cheeses, small desserts, salty snacks, etc. The quality of the catering overall on those is also improved from the ones that used to sit in the fridge at the old lounge.\n","\n","After dining, there were very comfortable leather chairs with ottomans you could put your feet up on looking out over the tarmac and North Shore mountains in the distance to watch the planes land. Each chair had a wooden side table that had a pull out drawer with power and usb power outlets. Nice touch!\n","\n","Overall this is a great improvement to the Cathay service out of YVR.  Bravo, Cathay!!!!!!!\n","Let's face it, when it comes to entertainment at night, there are limited options in greater vancouver. Sure, you can go club or bar hopping at Granville street or walking along robson street. But it's not the same as a family friendly, lively, open area with lots of buzzing activity all around you. The Richmond Night Market successfully fills that void. If you are looking for an exciting social scene where you try new food, go people watching, play some carnival games, and shop for homemade things you just can't find anywhere else, this is THE place to go.  \n","\n","I visited the night market on the first night that it opened. On this visit, parking was a breeze.  The line up to get inside took about  -  minutes which is expected.  \n","\n","The entertainment stage was pretty lame with people from the community with no talent performing random acts.\n","\n","If you want to buy stuff at the market though, well for the vast majority of people, you will be disappointed.  Half of the things that were sold consisted of Etsy type stores where the seller made homemade stuffed animals, sculptures made of wood or metal, jewellry, hard rock stickers, keychains, and figurines.  The other half consisted of eBay/Alibaba junk from east asia like Anime merchandise, Anime socks, funny looking clothing, makeup and cellphone accessories.   There used to be Pokemon related merchandise but this year they were strangely non-existent.  \n","\n","But the MAIN reason a lot of people come here is the food. In my opinion, most the food here is mediocre at best. There are a few good ones though. Pretty much all of them are  % overpriced compared to regular restaurants. Most of them are very greasy typical east asian street food.  The portions are kind of small, like a tapas sized dish.  Each of these dishes cost $ - . You'll easily be spending $ + before you know it. Despite this, if you bring friends and have deep pockets, then you'll have good time.  Think of it as a shared experience with friends trying unique food, but in a lively outdoor setting.\n","\n","Here are some recommendations for food stalls i think you should try:\n","taiyaki red bean fish shaped waffles\n","BBQ squid (the one near the center of everything)\n","Takoyaki seafood balls (the one in the middle aisle)\n","Chef James' BBQ (the one near the giant steamed seafood stall)\n","Real fruit Slushies\n","\n","Some unique food I found that are instagram worthy:\n","A drink that includes a lightbulb shaped cup that glows in different colors\n","A very long churro that includes an inflatable flamingo toy \n","A drink with foggy gas bubbling out from the sides of the cup with glowing lights inside\n","\n","Just DON'T try the shwarma. It's bland and horrible. \n","\n","TL;DR/Summary: \n","Overpriced, (mostly east asian) food with a handful of good and unique looking food. Mostly mediocre food quality.  The stuff you can buy is mostly cute east asian toys and accessories, cell phone accessories, and handmade homemade trinkets. Great place to bring friends and having a fun time in a lively, outdoor setting after dark. \n","\n","Another thing to note...it will get VERY busy around about  : - , especially near the food stalls.  And if you have a big group of people, buy the coupon book! You save a little bit of money on food.\n","I haven't been wowed like this for 'Shanghainese' food for a long time, a very long time. With the sudden surge of popularity and choices for dishes like 'Xiao Long Bao' (XLB for short) and everyone claiming their handmade steamed dumplings are the \"BOMB\" and then being not disappointed, but leaving no lasting impression on me I had a great experience here that has already made my mind plot out the next time I shall come back to eat here again, whether it's the same order, or other things on the menu I will be back sooner than you think!\n","\n","With that being said, this place is located right next to Claypot Hot Pot, and if you know this plaza, depending on what time of the day you are in here, the parking lot can be a freaking zoo. People driving cars that they are incapable of driving, spots that are not suited for big vehicles (door ding plaza delight!) and that's not even getting out of your car yet. Then you gotta get here, and the day we were here (remember the early shift shuts down at  !) at about  :  it was packed on the outside. There is no real waiting area here, so it's better to just wait outside, but that maybe a bad idea if they call your name, as on this occassion they went by a couple of two, that had to re-position themselves on the waiting sheet.\n","\n","The restaurant is actually a fair size, with some big tables, mostly rectangular  's, so you could play Tetris in here to get the right combination, but if your coming in a big group for the morning rush, all I can say to you, is good luck to you! So we waited, as it was just me and my partner, not too long,   minutes, and at this time we already looked through the menu/self order sheet. You can ask for the english sheet, and just tick (or number) the dishes you are wanting, price is also listed on this as well.\n","\n","This place is busy, from the people eating, to the workers running left and right to serve, and clean the tables to the staff in the kitchen wrapping the XLB's fresh, to cooking up all the food that needs to be served, yet the service here is pretty good. On occassion I was asking for chili oil, and other things, and they quickly got it to me, and they were running around busy!\n","\n","So between the two of us, we ordered a savoury soy milk, XLB, savoury sticky rice balls, and my delightful 'chi fan gao' or fried blocks of stick rice! The savoury soy milk is always a great starter for a Shanghainese first meal of the day. This one was clean, as you can really taste the soy, and they did not over pollute this dish by adding too much dried shrimp, or pickled vegetables, and added a tiny bit of chili oil for flavour and color. Some Chinese donut pieces that were thinly sliced were swimming above, and this hit the spot!\n","\n","When the XLB arrived, I was surprised to see these   very plump dumplings. Looking at the detailed folds from above, and the thin-ness of the skin, where you can see the soup soaking the meat inside, I just wanted to dip my chopsticks in. Even though some of the XLB's were stuck together due to expanding while cooking, with some precision chopstick work we were able to seperate each without having the skin break, and the soup escape to the murky depths of the bamboo steamer! You could literally fill a Chinese soup spoon with the soup of one XLB, and the flavour was just perfect, so good that you really didn't even need the vinegar. \n","\n","Next came the savoury sticky rice balls, they had sharp tips on them to show that they weren't machine made. The skin on them, was sticky, chewy, not too much so, and held the meaty surprise with all the juices inside. I saw my partner smiling after chewing into one, and almost having the juice squirt at her, as she was not expecting it to be so delicious. After trying this, I am very intrigued on trying their black sesame ones..... till next time... which will be soon.\n","\n","When my partner pointed out the fried stick rice block (chi fan gao) I was just ecstatic. As in another review, to find this dish at any Shanghainese restaurant is a rarity, even to find it in Shanghai is rare, unless you know what street vendor to go to. The dish came, nicely deep fried, where you can tell that they were using clean oil. Each square piece held together just right, and biting into one was like reliving my childhood. This is an evil dish too cause it's just rice..... but it's oh so freaking good!\n","\n","The bill came to less than $ , and we were stuffed, but already talking about what we wanted to order next time. Now this is what I call a memorable meal, that I shall return. Also to note that the other dishes we saw at other tables were huge. From the soup noodles to the fried noodles and pastries, not monster big, but definitely not being ripped off. The price is right, and the food is excellent! Also remember CASH ONLY... no problem!\n","Had a Groupon I bought for $ .  for $ .  towards crab. \n","\n","First bad impression, before I even sat down my chair was full of crumbs...??? Clean much ?\n","\n","Found out with the Groupon they only had   menu choice.  The   crab meal for about $ . .  I asked was there anything else we can order and she said no, it's either that or the $ .  value of the Groupon.  (She was quite rude about it). \n","\n","We were debating on the fresh steamed crab or the black bean...black bean only because the waitress said it was \"number one\". \n","\n","So we trusted her and ordered the black bean. \n","\n","A word of advice....if you are eating \"fresh\" crab always get it steamed....can't really go wrong with steamed. (Or maybe they can I don't know). \n","\n","Please note I'm  % Chinese when I say this and I've seen this done at almost every Chinese restaurant that serves crab.  \n","\n","Most Chinese operated businesses always strive to cut costs at any expense (look at China..lead..etc) anything to literally save a dime...no a nickle. \n","\n","Please note I have no proof this restaurant does this, but this is standard practice for Chinese restaurants....especially if their lively hood is crab. \n","\n","They will have the front case full of large fresh crab and use illegally obtained undersized crabs to cook with.  What do you think they do with the dead ones? ....  One thing about deep frying a crab you can hide the freshness.  They can literally deep fry frozen/dead crab and most people wouldn't know the difference.  I have eaten crab plucked right from the ocean, so I know what fresh is and what I ate, was nothing close to fresh. \n","\n","Presentation was nice but when the crab arrived at our table, I was fooled.  The waitress said it comes with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob.  It was greasy deep fried potatoes and   tiny pieces (about  \" in length) over cooked corn.  Hummm definition of \"corn on the cob\" an ear of corn served whole\". \n","\n","Lies all lies !!!!!! Or they are playing the \" I don't know English card\" \n","\n","Crab was so so dry and full of grease.  If you looked closely at my pictures you can see this.  You may ask what is all the little crumbs? .... It's deep fried batter mixed with msg.  You would think it would be herbs, black bean, garlic etc... Deep fried msg batter??? \n","\n","I complained to   waitress about the dryness of the crab which is completely unacceptable for a place that specializes in \"crab\", and the   itty bitty pieces of corn...for $ . . \n","\n","Funny you would think   full crabs has   claws, one on each side of the crab.  My obviously disabled crabs only had   claws total.  This place will rip you off!! They are complete scammers and liars. So incredibly dishonest!  And you know what they don't care.  They simply don't give a flying FU..K what you as a customer thinks. \n","\n","They don't give a shit here, they don't ask you how is everything or how your meal was....they simply don't give it shit and it shows. \n","\n","This place is a one off...meaning you come here once and you will never ever come back again. \n","\n","The worst crab I've ever had in my life! EVER! Maybe because I'm spoiled with fresh seafood right from the ocean, or I expect to get what I pay for when dinning out.  \n","\n","I have had better illegally caught crab at hole in the wall Chinese restaurants that they give away for FREE when you order   dishes or more.  They also deep fry their crab but shitty hole in the wall places do it better then here. \n","\n","Fool me once...urgggg!!!  \n","\n","I asked for the bill and paid the exact amount ONLY. \n","\n","I told the waitress that I did not leave a tip because of the issues I had and I already felt I way over paid for what I received.  There was basically no service, and what \"service\" they give you it was way way way below standard. They literally plop your food on the table and that's it. \n","\n","Stand behind your food, if a customer complains for any reason fix it.  Smile at your customers once in a while.  Your not in China anymore your in Canada and we have standards.\n","\n","How dare you come to Canada and run a business with no standards, with no pride. \n","I guess they are happy with their one time customers.  \n","\n","Tourist do not be fooled, this place is still standing because of you.  Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.  Your wallet and your peace of mind will thank you. \n","\n","PS \n","\n","Remember to read all the \"non recommended reviews\" at the bottom of the page.\n","After eating dim sum in Hong Kong years ago, I found that my taste for it waned once I returned to the U.S. Everything here was greasy, sometimes bland, of poorer quality. So I rarely ate dim sum. Then I read that Vancouver Chinese food was  a close approximation to Hong Kong Chinese food. Hope gushed forth again in me belly.\n","\n","On a Sunday, I rushed over to the Lansdowne Mall, thinking Gingeri would be packed by  :  A.M.  I had forgotten Vancouverites enjoy life and apparently sleep. Gingeri was empty but for a handful of people. With my prejudice against empty restaurants, I didn't go in. So after some roaming around looking at closed shops, some ladies doing tai chi with tassels, I decided to go back to the Gingeri, which had good Yelp reviews.\n","\n","Well, Gingeri, your dim sum has now stopped me from lamenting about not having Hong Kong Chinese food. The menu is inventive, with so many types of dim sum to choose from and many kinds that I don't see in NY. Unfortunately, with my friend having gone back to NY, I could only try three kinds. Clinton K. said their dim sum was average size. Well, I can't wait for another dim sum trip to Vancouver to see what other restaurants will delight me, because the size of mine were big. The shrimp were larger than normal in my larger than usual shrimp rice noodles, and were tender and succulent. I tried something new to me, the fish maw and shrimp paste dumplings in soup. It was so fresh, with a hint of ginger. My red bean in osmanthus jelly pudding was so pretty I stared at it for a bit before devouring it after contemplating taking it away in a doggie back. Everything I had was quite tasty and lacked the profusion of cheap, overused oil I find so distasteful in the dim sum here. I would have loved to try more but my stomach can only stretch so far.\n","\n","Service was polite and efficient, but definitely laid back. You mark what you want on the menu and they take it away and cook it for you. I was there  .  hours, ordered only   dishes and it got crowded only later. There was definitely a long wait between plates but no one was rushing me or putting strangers at my table.The place is pretty, with strange modern decor and ceilings and is very clean.\n","\n","A note, apparently when you pay, they presume any change you give is their tip. I was waiting for them to return my bill with the change to give a better tip. Finally the waitress realized I was signaling her to ask for my change and I saw her look of annoyance when she thought I wasn't leaving even a cheaper tip until she realized I was putting down more money on the table. Not sure what the etiquette in this place is, but it seems you add the tip you want to your bill and give it to them when you pay the check and don't leave it on the table.\n","Concept:\n"," \"Da Lang\"\n"," or  \"Late Night\"\n","Simply put, this is the Chinese style of late night cuisine, which is widely popular in different places of Asia with different variations. \"Da Lang\" is originated in the Chaozhou, China. Till this day, a lot of late night eateries in Asia are opened in a \"Dai Pai Dong\"  setting, which means it's in an outdoor food stall setting. Unfortunately, a lot of these are being closed down because of health regulations.\n","The traditional dishes served in this type of cuisine are:\n","Braised Meat in special prepared soy marinates. (IE: Duck, Intestine, beef, ETC)\n","Chilled crab with special dipping sauce\n","Congee\n","Various fresh seafood prepared in different ways (steamed, pan fried, deep fried, ETC)\n","\n"," \n","\n","Hou Lok Restaurant:\n","This restaurant is what I consider as a hidden gem in Richmond. Local patrons usually frequent this restaurant at late night hours. While some would be standing in the cold for a quick slice or donair stand after a night of partying or working, you can come in with your group of friends and order warm tapa style plates for a  very economic price.\n","\n","\n","As you can see, there are a lot of items only written in Chinese that is posted on the wall. Luckily, you can order what we ordered if you like. Print out the list provided below and hand it to the server. =)\n","\n","\n","\n","You might also want to check out the single sheet late night menu. The concept is simple, you order up to $  and they will throw in a big bowl of congee.\n","\n","Steamed Oyster: We ordered one of each: Garlic, Garlic Pepper, and Soy Sauce. First of all, the oysters were gigantic. They were so fresh and all the ingredients help lift up the original taste of the oyster.\n","\n","Pan Fried Oyster Omelette: Oyster Omelette is very popular in Taiwan. This dish does not disappoint. There is no fishiness in the oysters at all. The eggs are slight brunt to give it that crunchy texture. A red vinegar dip is provided to give it that extra lift.\n","\n","Clams in Black Sauce: Black Sauce? It's fermented black bean sauce used in applications of fish and other seafood. I have to suggest that this is not for everyone, because it does have a really strong and unique taste. Asian families that are used to it adore it from the kitchen of their own homes to restaurants alike.\n","\n","Pickled Vegetable with Pork Intestines: I have featured intestines on the blog before and I understand it is very adventurous to those who haven't tried it. I can't stress enough that it has some of the best textures when cooked properly. Bouncy chewy texture, but not to a point where its eraser / tire like. The pickled vegetable provides the dish with a strong sour taste. If I must compare, it's the same concept as sauerkraut.\n","\n","Sauteed Mustard Greens with Garlic: Mustard Green in my opinion is a grown up's vegetable. Kids do not like espresso much like this vegetables bitterness. People love bitterness as they get older because they often find a sweet\n","aftertaste.\n","So next time you and your pals are in Richmond past midnight. Come into Hou Lok and experience what Chinese Late Night has to offer.\n","Came here with the family since my mom was intrigued to see a Taiwanese place open up in the area as she read through their mail-in coupons. The coupons were for ordering a select dish and getting a free bubble tea for it. \n","\n","We came here on the Father's day weekend to try it out and at first they sat us by a table by the window but asked if we could move to another one, which was fine as we were just ushered to our seat but one of the seats at the new table that they moved us to was extremely dirty with food bits all over it which we were going to just sweep off but when we pulled out the chairs for one side, there was food all over the floor; at least a handful of rice grains and pieces of meat all scattered the floor. We asked the staff if they could either clean it up or let us move back to our previous table and they opted for the latter. (This review is getting the two star because shortly after us, another family came into the restaurant and they sat the family at the same dirty table without cleaning up even after we had informed them. Perhaps the family were too busy with their small children to notice the mess on the floor but there must have been food stuck onto the bottom of their shoes when they left!) Pretty gross in my personal opinion but I guess to each guest their own. \n","\n","The coupons are limited one per person and not per table so we used two. We got to try out the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the Typhoon Chicken Nuggets. Personally loved the chicken nuggets! They put pickled Taiwanese vegetables and lemon on the chicken nuggets so if you're more of a fan of the authentic taiwanese chicken nuggets that are tossed with fried basil leaves, would not recommend trying the Typhoon Chicken Nuggets. The plate size is good for sharing but I was the only one that really liked the dish. It wasn't what my family was expecting. \n","\n","The Taiwanese beef noodle soup is rather average but the meat pieces are very tender. \n","\n","My brother got the chicken fried rice which comes in a small plate. The chicken is just regular chicken as opposed to Taiwanese style nuggets. \n","\n","They've got late night drink specials here as well as student discounts. \n","\n","Overall, wasn't too impressed with the service as a group of people came in near the end of our meal. It seemed like they had a pretty big reservation and that the reasoning for the staff moving us to the dirty table initially was to accommodate this reservation as they pretty much took over the whole restaurant (leaving only two empty tables). Thankfully, we were almost done but I would have felt extremely claustrophobic and rushed to finish my meal as this large group hovered over table. Not the customers' fault but more of how the staff said yes to the booking and did not account for how the table arrangements would be made and they were definitely not ready to host such reservation as there was only one waitress for the whole place. \n","Also, the dirty chair I could have let slide as well as the floor, if the staff made an effort to clean up but the fact that she was just idling for a bit before the other family came irritates me a little as she could have cleaned up the area for them. She was very informed that the area was dirty but made no effort to clean up and even sat another party there...\n","\n","Don't think I'll be back here, coupons or no coupons. Our family actually has four people and we only used two so... this doesn't seem like a newly opened place as I saw older reviews and there are many other Taiwanese restaurants in Richmond that I feel can execute a little better.\n","On our way to an Alaskan Cruise, we decided to stop here for dinner.  As a party of  , we were seated pretty quickly.  That's about where the good vibes stopped for me.\n","\n","You see, I get pretty bad migraines and my #  trigger is loud noises.  As I usually do in loud situations, I put in my eargasms which allow me to bring down the volume considerably but still allows me to hear and interact with people just fine.\n","\n","When it came time to order, I *TRIED* to get pad thai with tofu.  Apparently annoyed at me for some unknown reason, he starts arguing with me that he doesn't have pad thai with tofu.  He kept telling me it wasn't on the menu.  \"Where did you see it on the menu?  Are you sure you can read the menu right?\", was what he asked me. \n","\n","I pointed to pad thai in the menu and he kept telling me that it comes with shrimp chicken and tofu.  Well, in my view, if there are   ingredients and I only want one of them, why wouldn't it be possible?  I, again, stated that \"I want the pad thai with just tofu\" and he replied \"You want vegetarian pad thai?  Are you sure?\"\n","\n","So.. I said \"Yes.  Vegetarian pad thai with only tofu.  No shrimp or chicken.\"\n","\n","He continued to acost me verbally saying that it's not on the menu and that I clearly didn't read the menu correctly.  I got so upset that I just said, \"Why can't you just make me the pad thai and leave out the shrimp and chicken?  Isn't that vegetarian pad thai?\"  \n","\n","At this point, he lost it and started yelling in my ear saying \"Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  WE DON'T HAVE PAD THAI WITH TOFU!!!!!!!!!\"\n","\n","Seriously, what the hell?  I was conversing with him just fine before and now he thinks I can't hear him because he notices my ear plugs.  I flipped out and started yelling back at him saying \"What's your freakin' problem!?  I was talking to you just fine and if you're going to be a dick about it, maybe we should just leave?  What's YOUR problem?\"\n","\n","He then started making all these excuses saying that he wasn't sure if I could hear him because I had something in my ears.  Despite me talking to him just a few moments earlier and answering his questions he was being a dick by not taking ownership of his stupidity.   I basically told him that he was being an asshole and that he should be fired for being an ass and not knowing how to make pad thai with ONLY tofu.  If he couldn't figure that out, he shouldn't be in the food business.  My raging migraine went nuclear at this point and I told him that if he continued to yell at me, I'm going to have to find his car and puke all over it.\n","\n","Anyways, I was so frustrated with the dumbsh*t waiter that I just ordered pad thai with everything.  Once it came, it was basically the worst pad thai I have ever had.  It was a tomato sauce based pad thai and was totally white washed asian fare.  Gross.  Imagine banana ketchup over half cooked rice noodles.  Not quite ketchup, overly sweet, no where near what pad thai is supposed to taste like.\n","\n","The rest of the crew got their orders and the kids didn't particularly like any of it either.  The only thing they finished was the roti.  The only thing that I ate that was good was the beef satay, eggplant, and pineapple fried rice.\n","\n","The food was less than spectacular, to say the least.  Some of the dishes were OK but overall, it was just a \"meh.. I'm hungry and the food court next door is closed -- I've got no choice\" experience.  If it was just me and my family, I would have walked out the moment he flipped out but when you're in a group of   with hungry kids you gotta do what you gotta do.\n","\n","Bottom line is that if you're into verbal abuse and frustration, this is your place!  I certainly wouldn't return for the food.  I sure hope that server gets fired -- I just wish I got the guy's name.\n","\n","Goodbye Tropika!  You won't be missed.\n","Terrible food, appauling service, disappointing ambiance and overpriced. \n","\n","This was the worst restaurant experience that we've had in years. We sorely regret not going to one of the takeout huts on the pier instead of this place. \n","\n","FOOD: \n","The corn/crab chowder (that took   minutes!) Was just corn chowder. \n","\n","The slider trio tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for ages. The meat was dried up and bread was hard as a rock - inedible.\n","\n","The calamari was the worst calamari that we've had in years. Frozen to fryer, no taste, no seasoning and overdone. This is when we realized that all their food is most likely from GFS, not the daily catch like every other place nearby. \n","\n","The fish tacos came with frozen guacamole in them... Fish was over fried. Oil was dark and looked old. \n","\n","The salmon sandwich came on a cheap hamburger bun. For $ , you can afford some decent bread. The salmon was overcooked, and tasted like it was done in a salamander (poor choice - but quicker than other cooking methods - still took   minutes to arrive). \n","\n","SERVICE: \n","The service was appauling. \n","\n","There were   hosts on (or the servers were just chilling at the host stand). None of the hosts smiled or seemed friendly. \n","\n","Our server took   minutes to come to the table to greet us (the restaurant was not busy). She did not apologize for the  delay. She did not ask us if we needed help with the menu or make any sort of small talk with us to engage us on a personal level at all during any interaction. She never came by to quality check our food (apps or mains). She disappeared for a while during our wait for our food. We assume she was standing in the kitchen waiting for our food, but she never communicated to us that there was a delay in the kitchen or apologized for the delay when the food arrived. \n","\n","One dish came out incorrect. A different server dropped off the incorrect plate (fries served instead of salad). Proper etiquette would have been to leave the dish on the table, apologize, and bring out the correct  side complimentary. This of course was not what happened. The plate was removed and brought back to the kitchen while a new side was prepared, then the whole dish was brought back to the table and re-presented (we had already been in the resturant for over an hour by this point and we were quite agitated that we were still waiting on our food). Our regular server also did not apologize for this mix up. Maybe she was not informed that this had even happened. \n","\n","The bartender (who we could hear over the music) had no idea what the wine was that I ordered with my lunch was and she had to ask a server what it was. The bartender was actually cringe worthy to watch. She made drinks very slow, made them poorly, grabbed glassware by the rim of the glass before serving them to guests (unsanitary), and she seemed to have a poor attitude with a false confidence to her. (I'd recommend completing retraining her and giving her a menu knowledge and service expectation test. If she fails she should be terminated). The sangria that she made was just a bit of wine with oj and water and citrus. She actually squeezed lemon wedges into it. I wanted to go behind the bar and teach her how to make a sangria. \n","\n","AMBIANCE: \n","Non existent. They were playing elevator music at a low level. We could hear the service staff conversations above the music, which really ruined the atmosphere. \n","\n","What is with the ceiling? It's a real eye sore. High ceilings are a bonus, but not when they look gross. Maybe cover those with some draped white curtains like they do in barn weddings. \n","\n","They had almost an entirely female staff and we think they were trying for a Joeys or Cactus Club vibe, but failing miserably.\n","\n","Management needs to be on the floor speaking with guests and rectifying issues. Where was the manager during all this? \n","\n","All staff severely need customer service training/re-training. Watching interactions at other tables, smiles are definitely not very high on anyones priority list. \n","\n","Kitchen needs a solid sous chef back there quality checking on expo before food leaves the pass. Do you know how to sous vide? It might solve a bunch of your timeliness and food quality problems.\n","Due to the large number of dim sum restaurants in the area, it's not unusual for us to go for years before returning to a restaurant that we've previously tried before... even one that we've quite enjoyed. Sun Sui Wah used to be one of the more popular dim sum restaurants in Vancouver/Richmond (they have locations in both cities) but I had heard that the food quality had declined recently.\n","\n","Still, we wanted to see for ourselves so we visited their Richmond location in mid-September. Steamed Beef Balls ($ . ) was always a favourite as a child as it's a fairly simple dish.\n","\n","Similarly, the Chinese Donut Rice Roll ($ . ) is popular due to how fun they are to eat and the mixture of soft and crunchy textures.\n","\n","We wanted to try some dim sum dishes that we've never had before so this was the Steamed Mo Qua with Fish Paste ($ . ). The mo qua (a type of squash with a delicately sweet flavour) was firm and absorbed the flavour of the sauce, which was also served with mushrooms.\n","\n","This next dish was my fault because I thought that Mushroom Siu Mai ($ . ) sounded interesting. I had thought they meant that the filling had mushrooms in it but, as it turned out, the pork and shrimp filling was sandwiched between two shiitake mushrooms. Honestly, this wasn't that great.\n","\n","Fortunately, the Pan-Fried Daikon Cake ($ . ) was much better. The lo bak go had little bits of Chinese sausage embedded in it and wasn't the least bit dry.\n","\n","After seeing some of the dishes that the other tables were ordering, we made a point to come back a week later to order some of those dishes.\n","\n","The traditional Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai ($ . ) was much better than the mushroom version that we had last week.\n","\n","Next up was the Sauteed Clams in Black Bean Sauce ($ . ).\n","\n","Speaking of black bean sauce, we also ordered the Tofu, Eggplant, and Green Pepper with Fish Paste and Black Bean Sauce ($ . ). I really enjoyed this dish!\n","\n","On our last visit, we had considered ordering the Deep-Fried Crab Claw with Shrimp Paste ($ .  for   pieces) as we usually only get deep-fried crab claws at special dinners. Even at the restaurants that offer it as a side dish tend to charge $  per claw so we thought these claws would be super small. As it turns out, they looked pretty much like the real deal. I suppose they keep the cost down by substituting cheaper shrimp paste within the filling. In either case, they were served with a sweet and sour sauce and were pretty tasty!\n","\n","The Mango Pudding ($ . ) was served with a sticky almond-sliver cookie which stuck to my teeth. Honestly didn't need the drizzling of sweet red jam-like sauce on the mango pudding.\n","\n","Our Steamed Beef Rice Rolls ( . ) was the last dish to arrive and were well formed with a meaty filling enhanced with parsley.\n","\n","Overall, there are some good and bad dim sum dishes here but I felt I was pleased with most of them. If you want to avoid the dim sum rush, make sure to come before   as it tends to get busy after that.\n","With a few days of Vancouver sightseeing and eating in the rearview, our second venture into the world of Dim Sum would be the last day of our stay in Canada and with a Canucks game plus Phnom Penh to look forward to plus great word of mouth from a couple of trusted sources we arrived at Jade Seafood Restaurant approximately twenty minutes after opening - a good thing, too, as the restaurant was already  /  full thanks to the morning  % discount.  Again welcomed by a pleasant host who inquired about reservations that we did not have it would be only a few moments before she found someone who spoke English to assist us and lead us to a seat in the center of the room - a room where we were once again the only Caucasian's to be found.  \n","\n","Greeted next by our waiter, a middle aged gentleman who spoke excellent English, menus were provided and tea was poured - this time a pleasant green variety at an unannounced charge of $  per person along with ice water - much more practical than the boiling pot at Sea Harbour two days prior.  Sitting and drinking the tea while weighing our options and chuckling at the rather traditional room still decorated for Christmas we decided this time to avoid over ordering and to instead go with two large items, two dim-sum selections, and two desserts - all of which were deemed 'good choice' by our waiter who hustled back to the kitchen as it appeared he was serving no fewer than ten tables.\n","\n","Sitting and chatting while we waited no more than fifteen minutes I have to say we were all a bit surprised when two waiters returned carrying four of our six choices and while I must say that each was beautifully executed I cannot help but think that they all would have been even better had they arrived separated so we could enjoy them all hot - a small quibble perhaps, but something that was most notable in the first of the choices, \"E-Fu noodles with Crab and Mushroom,\" as the savory ginger and scallion broth, abundant sweet crab, fibrous mushrooms, and tender noodles were wonderful when piping hot but significantly less so once they had cooled as we sampled the other items.\n","Moving next to a pairing of familiar items - one a quartet of snappy Har-Gow with a delicate wrapper and crunchy shrimp kissed with ginger on the inside and the second a dish that seemed much more French or American than Chinese but a dish that impressed all of us in the form of \"Baked Mushroom Pastry,\" an intensely earthy and savory blend of soy and sauteed mushrooms in an impossibly light shell that literally melted in the mouth.\n","\n","Moving next to the less traditional selection of the dim sum savories, Steamed Milk and Pumpkin Cake would also prove quite tasty with the flavor somewhere between angel food cake and canned pumpkin pie mix and the texture somewhere between bread pudding and flan -the combination certainly something more sweet than savory but a nice juxtaposition to the other items currently on the table.\n","\n","With the first four choices being shared around the rest of our meal would arrive perhaps fifteen minutes later as a duo - one sweet, one savory, and both delicious.  Beginning first with the sweet, a dish titled Deep Fried Milk with Mango Sugar would arrive as eight crispy fritters laced with the smell of coconut and a soft pudding-like interior consisting of little more than coconut milk and condensed milk but lovely none the less.  Slightly sweet on their own but served with a bowl of fruity sugar these little delights reminded me mostly of funnel cake at the fare, something I've not had in ages but was glad to indulge in.\n","\n","For the final dish of the morning and perhaps the most unexpectedly delicious item I've ever had as part of a Chinese meal, Sauteed Pumpkin with Salted Egg would arrive on a large plate with a bed of lettuce and appearing to merely be fried pumpkin I was astounded when I bit into my first piece to find it far more nuanced and elegant than I could have imagined.  Seemingly made only from pumpkin, preserved egg yolks, and perhaps a bit of wine and shallots each bite of this dish started with a salty crispness that immediately gave way to the sweetness of the creamy pumpkin within.  Bite after bite all I could do was sit there wondering how this item isn't more prevalent on Chinese menus and how such a simple combination (eggs, pumpkin, seasoning) had never occurred to me before - a situation I've remedied by making similar meals thrice since returning to Ohio.\n","\n","With service excellent throughout and the bill tallying less than  /  of what was spent at Sea Harbour I can say without much hesitation that I would return to Jade for dim sum or dinner and while I cannot say that is a ringing endorsement given my limited experience with Chinese cuisines I can say that meals like this one make me want to seek out similar experiences in the future.\n","Oh Kirin. How you make me work. \n","\n","I originally trekked out to Kirin this past Saturday and thought that a wait for party of one wouldn't be too bad, despite all the warnings that you should call ahead to make a reservation. \n","\n","When I stumbled up to the third floor at about  : , I discovered that the wait would be until about  . I was shocked.  I immediately left and went to Neptune up the street and waited for maybe about ten minutes before I was seated. \n","\n","On Monday, I tried yet again. I failed to realize that it was Thanksgiving in Canada, but at least this time I learned my lesson and called in advance on Sunday night. I was told at that point that they were hooked until about  :  but if I came around  :  they might be able to accommodate me. No guarantees that they'd have the specials though. Screw that, I thought. \n","\n","Well third time is a charm. I made a reservation for  :  today - right when they open. I was seated promptly. The dining area wasn't full but there were already about ten or fifteen parties (a total of a quarter of the restaurant) only ten minutes after opening. \n","\n","I ordered the fish paste and bean curd rice roll, durian mochi and thousand layer cake. \n","\n","First things first, you don't use a cart or paper to order here. You actually order off a menu with the waitress, just like at a restaurant for dinner. It was the first time I ordered that way at a dim sum place. \n","\n","The rice roll was huge. It probably came with seven or eight substantial, larger than bite size pieces. This is nothing like what you can get in LA. The fish paste did not taste fishy and the texture was not overly mushy or rubbery. The crispy fried bean curd on the outside almost resembled a Chinese donut at first, but it was actually much more refined. And the rice roll itself was quality. It comes with a side of soy sauce so you can control how much sodium intake you want. And the rice roll itself is scattered with some scallions for that extra touch. Light but satisfying!\n","\n","Durian Mochi is a special here and you definitely need to order it. It is served slightly chilled. The Mochi is soft, not overly thick, and the durian filling is fresh, not overwhelming and also contains some cream. I'm always partial to durian desserts, and this was no exception! \n","\n","My last dish was the steamed thousand layer cake. There is more than meets the eye here.  It contains white and orange layers. The white is a regular white steamed cake like traditional Chinese buns. But the orange layers are a treat: there is a mixture of salted egg yolk (hence the coloring), pineapple, and coconut. It was light and airy but full of flavor and texture. Yum. \n","\n","Service:  the waitstaff is on point here, probably more so here than at many Chinese restaurants I have been to. I had credit card complications but they were very nice and patient with me. It all worked out and I felt like I was treated very warmly. It also helps that they don't charge extra for tea during dim sum - basically it's incorporated in the price. \n","\n","Bottom line: refined dim sum that you can't get everywhere. Worth a trip (with a reservation of course) if you're in the Vancouver area.\n","I've been to this restaurant a few times and their service has always been consistently questionable. Service and attentiveness was always lacking when I visited for both lunch and dinner. It was brought to my attention that they had a pasta promotion so we took the risk and tried again. I'm pretty sure that was my last visit and will avoid eating there again. \n","\n","Service and attentiveness - There seemed to be a \"nothing is my business\" mentality between the servers. Upon arrival, waiting at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign, multiple servers saw me standing there but it was not until I waved that someone appointed another server to have me seated. I was ready to order and notified someone and she said she would get my server; I waited   minutes and had to flag down someone and when he came up to our table, there was no helpfulness and instead I truly felt that I was inconveniencing him. Our dishes were practically tossed and dropped at our table. My spoon was caught under a plate and almost went flying when a dish was dropped off, the server noticed it and apologized but he was already walking away almost completely turned around. The rest of the dishes came but the server would just drop them off at the edge of the table closest to him. When we were ready for the bill, I had to ask twice again. The first server I approached for the bill came back into our area serving another table and no bill for us, and then I had to flag down another server for our bill. It shouldn't be this difficult for standard basic service at a restaurant. \n","\n","Honoring a promotion - I fully understand that there will always be a catch when ordering from the special promotional menu. There was a   for   pasta promotion; order   pasta dishes and pay for  . The pasta dishes were unusually small but we understand that it was a promotion so we accepted it. At one point we considered ordering more because the pasta dishes were very small; however, it was such a turn off that it was going to require so much effort to get the servers' attention for anything so opted out. The experience was not great but somewhat expected. It wasn't until the next day when we saw the ad again and noticed that along with the pasta, garlic bread, salad and appetizers were included.  Salad and appetizers never came. \n","\n","If the servers don't enjoy serving, get a different job. When customers order from the special menu and can't get the same treatment as customers ordering from the regular menu, don't offer a special menu. If not all inclusions form the promotional ad is honored/served, don't advertise a promotional menu. I recognize that Kyung Bok Palace is not fine dining but standard basic service in a restaurant setting is not too much to expect. \n","\n","Maybe it was just my bad luck and hope you all a better experience.\n","This is a review of their three tier high tea set that you can get from  :  pm to  :  pm, every day other than Monday. \n","\n","Like many other people who find this place, it was Groupon who led us here. We made reservations a few hours before, but when we arrived at  :  in the afternoon the place was nearly empty. This might not always be the case, so call ahead.\n","\n","We didn't get a choice of tea, though they had a good selection of specialty teas like rose tea, lavender, Earl Grey and more on their menu. We did get a choice between coffee and tea though. Little odd, since this is a high tea set. Right. Since we were sitting down for a high tea, I assumed we would be getting a pot of tea. Not so. We were given a mug of hot water and a Twinings Darjeeling tea in tea bag form. Right. They automatically bring out little pitchers of cream (with a Darjeeling? oy) and were accommodating when I asked for milk. Normally, of course, Darjeeling doesn't need milk at all, but this was the powdery bits type tea (aka poor quality.) Also, when I had drank my cup of tea, they came around to fill back up my mug with hot water. Since I didn't want hot water that tasted like a hint of tea, I asked for another tea bag. They charged me for this, but never said so until I got the bill. Not too impressed with that. Also, they leave the hot water ready to go in glass pitchers on the bar counter for easy refilling. When the waitress refilled my cup, the water was lukewarm. \n","The tea aspect of this \"High tea\" was positively dismal. If tea is your thing, then come here with rock bottom expectations. If the tea sandwiches and desserts are your thing, well they did a much better job on that front. \n","\n","The tier was dropped off without any explanations of that was served. While I appreciate the fact that the server didn't have English as her language, an attempt could have been made. If you have allergies, be warned, you might have to tread blindly through this mine field. The sandwich was something you'd find from a deli, but the other savory foods were good. One was a tuna and egg combo, the other was a salmon and crepe mix. I did not like the salmon with the sweet crepe - just a little odd. The scones were rubbery, a sure sign of an inexperience hand over mixing the dough. The flavours were good, and the jelly/jam provided not nearly enough to cover both scones. Here is a tip, leave the scones alone for now. \n","The desserts on the top tier, like most high tea tiers, were the most fancy and delicate. They included a mango panna cotta that I wouldn't be surprised was from a grocery store, a strawberry tart that was delicious, and a chocolate mousse cake that had a chocolate ice cream puff on top. Very good! And once you've cleaned out the tiers (except for the scones, you haven't touched the scones yet right?) the experience isn't over yet. The server comes out with the very unusual addition to a high tea, chocolate fondue and fruits. Between the two of us, you get four slices of banana,  four slices of kiwi, four slices of apple and four marshmallows (so two each per person.)  Not all that much fare when you compare it to the vat of chocolate it comes with. This is where your scones come in. Once you've cleaned out the fruit and marshmallows, start tearing up your scones and dipping them into the chocolate. The jam/jelly it comes with doesn't really compare to the molten, liquid chocolate you could have instead. \n","\n","All in all, this isn't the place to go if you are a big tea person. But if you are on a date, then this is a fabulous place to go and have little desserts and chocolate fondue. And some \"tea\" or coffee.\n","Not going to lie if you decide to attend the night market get yourself, your mama,  your daddy and the rest of the family here super early to find parking. I am pretty sure you can hang out inside the River Rock Casino until it starts! If you decide to go after it opens in hopes that the people who arrived earlier will be leaving well then get ready to wait in traffic, drive off road to find a spot then deal with semi crabby people who just want to find a good spot just like you.  On the other hand, you could save the hassle all together and just park at Costco and walk on over like we did. Sure, it is a bit of a walk but it is worth it after we drove around in circles for a half hour in hopes of finding a better spot!\n","\n","This is my first time going to a night market, I always wanted to try the one in LA, but with so many people and the un-organization, I heard so much about it rather turned me off. Walking into the in Red Rock Casino outside events area I could tell that this night market was very organized, everyone from the traffic control to the line and ticket sellers were all on point. We did not have to stand in line too long to get inside. \n","\n","Ticket prices were awesome $ .  for adults and kids under   and seniors were free. They offered us a coupon book saving us $ .  we decided to bypass getting it since we were only in town for one night. \n","\n","Entering into the festival everything was so big and bright. The theme this year is magical candyland just picture huge rubber duckies, giant lollipops and other various sweets propped up around the area.\n","\n","We took some photos, and wonder up and down the vendors that were selling everything from handmade jewelry to freshly made Nordi chips.\n","\n","Finally we ended up in the food area (so that is where all the people have been hiding) we decided to bob and weave our way through all the people who were standing there eating. So many choices what to start with!  Here is the list of what we had there!\n","\n","Giant curry takoyaki from Daikichi-\n","These suckers were freshly made and hotter than hell once you bit into them (I burnt my mouth and tongue repeatedly).  \n","\n","Chef James with Xin Jiang Man BBQ-\n","The deal they had going on was too good not to pass up! Three meat sticks for $ . . I know what you are saying but these were worth it, these suckers had a lot of meat on them! We tried the chicken, steak and garlic shrimp skewers. Chef James is actually there grilling, you could tell by how he interacted with his staff that they love what they do.\n","The chicken was tender and juicy; the steak was melt in your mouth and the garlic shrimp I wanted more of! \n","\n","Dan Dan'S Smokehouse-\n","Ordered the Bacon wrapped enoki. This was delicious, two of my favorite things to eat. Bacon and mushrooms. Word to the wise let it cool off for about two-three minutes these are freshly made when you order!\n","\n","Georgio Pinoy BBQ-  \n","They claim to be the best BBQ in town. Therefore, we waited until their line died down a bit to order. Their special of the night was two thick cut steak skewers, which looked like it could feed more than two people!\n","After you order, have some patience because it does take time to cook these succulent meats. Believe me it is worth the wait! \n","Sinking my teeth into the tender meat, I could see why they say they are the best BBQ in town. The meat was perfectly cooked and the marinade was tasty.\n","\n","\n","\n","Is this night market worth it, heck yeah. It was a perfect way to end our Canada adventures!\n","The presentation of the food was nice, the server not so much. The presentation created a bit of an excitement to eat the food as it looked delicious. Upon eating the food, I would say that the appetizers are the best thing on their menu. The chicken wings we ordered were mild even though they were supposed to be hot, either way they tasted good. The veggie tempura was also good, they should consider drizzling the spicy sauce over the veggies as oppose to having it underneath the pile of veggies. No one had a chance to taste the sauce or knew there was sauce until most of the tempura was gone, the batter didn't have any flavoring to it either so you def. need a dip.  I ordered the Oscar steak, it said on their website that it comes with asparagus and a salad, well it doesn't. My steak was over cooked the first time around so I sent it back to be done properly, the manager did apologize but nonetheless I had to wait while the rest of my coworkers ate their food and we were pushed back on our time to be back at work because of this.  So I am a HUGE STEAK LOVER, unfortunately for a steak house it is sad that they don't know how to cook a steak properly. They masked the flavor of the steak with this gross sauce, I don't even know what it was because A. there was no description of the sauce on the menu/website and B. our waiter, when asked about what is on it did not mention anything about the sauce. Unfortunately, without the sauce the steak had no flavor... so I had to put a bunch of salt and pepper to the steak to make it taste good. For dessert I ordered a cheesecake, again waiter failed to mention key ingredients... the cheesecake had mint. I HATE mint.  So anyways, I had an overall crappy experience while my coworker loved his NY steak. Back to the service, our water was empty for the majority of the time, at one  point the person who had invited our team out to celebrate completing a project had to go and find the waiter to get a. his lemon wedges that he had asked for and b. some water. He did not bother to refill our waters again for the rest of our lunch.... Also, my coworker was choking on a piece of food and not ONE of the servers or anyone came to rescue her.. thank god I knew how to perform Heimlich maneuver and ended up saving her life (literally). No one even noticed, and let me tell you their restaurant wasn't busy at all.  The conclusion, when the waiter asked me how I liked my dessert I explained the mint situation, he didn't even bother to bring me another dessert or ask me for something else... he just gave us the bill and yes they removed the Oscar from the bill but that didn't fix anything. This was a  celebration but they made it into an unreal experience of horrible service and mediocre food.\n","You get what you pay for... you really do.. and there is a reason why there is so much, soooooo much, food leftover before closing if your buying something here to eat, or take home! We came here, my dear and I, as we were lazy, brought our self serve containers and prepared to buy two dishes to take home to eat with our greens and rice! I always wondered how these places in the food court are, and now I know exactly how they are, especially going down your stomach!\n","\n","The last time I have ever done takeout like this, it was at Kent's Kitchen in Chinatown, these places do not appeal to my appetite, but since we were going the cheap route, you make due with what is. When you come here just know that the next two stalls in this food court do the exact same thing, makes you wonder if they share the same kitchen? At a certain point of the day before closing prices get slashed to get rid of the over-cooking they have done and to just clear things, and there's always going to be lazy people who just take care of their needs to feed the family here. A ton of variety, from greens to proteins, all the staple dishes you would expect, from chow mein, some mixed fried rice, overly deep fried squid, sweet & sour pork, some buddha's feast dish just to name a few that I even remembered at this buffet like showing I saw.\n","\n","We came here with containers prepared to buy two dishes, my dear comes with these as she doesn't feel that there should be excess waste which is a good thing. After walking back and forth, left to right, right to left, we finally decided to buy from this location. It's funny to see a sign manually changed by hand,   bigger tin foil containers of food for $ , it will feed you and a family guaranteed. There's another one in the plaza that's a bit more expensive, makes us wonder if we should have went with them, but we decided to order a platter of sweet & sour pork, and also an order of beef brisket with bean curd and turnip. We gave our containers, they filled it, took our money, and zoom, off to home we went.\n","\n","Now to the dinner, for the pork, over battered, chewy, old.. well that's what it felt like.. something that been under the lamp a little too long, no sour, just sweet from the sauce, unappealing. Now for the brisket, another nice solid chewy thing, working the molars.. most definitely, the beancurd wasn't bad, a little shrivaled but really nothing to write home about.. or more like keep at home for another meal. We don't usually waste food, but I wonder where it went the next day as I didn't stay over to see round two of this meal.\n","\n","I wonder how this place is early in the morning when they first open, but rule of thumb, you get what you pay for, it would have been better just to have gone to a restaurant and order takeout!\n","We made a reservation for  :  and when we arrived there was a huge lineup in the waiting area. It was difficult to get to the hostess and when we did get to the front, she wasn't there. We didn't get our table right away but had a short wait of  -  minutes which is acceptable. \n","\n"," % off your bill before  : . I noticed many of the items served here at a higher price point compared to other dim sum places. But the quality and presentation explains why. I also liked that the quality is consistent throughout all the dishes. Most places ace at one and is terrible at another. So props for the consistency. \n","\n","We ordered:\n","\n","-Glutinous rice bun ( / ): This was our least favourite of all. It was steamed bun with sticky rice as the filling. The rice was slightly seasoned with soy and green onions I believe. Couldn't really tell. Avoid if you don't want carbs on carbs. \n","\n","-Custard bun ( / ): This came in a basket of three and I can already see the custard oozing out. Yum! Delicious! Not overly sweet but I could do with a bit more custard.\n","\n","-Fried pork dumplings - \"Ham sui gok\" ( . / ): These were of decent size. Served hot. There was ample filling. I liked them but they weren't the best I've eaten. All of equal size and nice presentation.\n","\n","-Rice roll with shrimp ( / ): Super thin wrap and silky smooth. Lack a bit in taste though. I guess that's why there's soy! \n","\n","-Rice roll with beef ( / ): Same as the above but with a bit more taste. I guess 'cause they added a bit of salt to the minced beef.\n","\n","-Ja Jiang noodles ( . / ): A bed of al dente egg noodles topped with minced meat and the sweet and spicy sauce. It was finished with some shredded cucumbers for a more refreshing taste. Loved the bounce in the noodles. The sauce was delicious as well. Mixed thoroughly so that every bite has the maximum flavour. \n","\n","-Sponge cake - \"Ma Lai Go\" ( / ): The best Ma Lai Go I've had! I loved the layers of this cake. The taste was just spot on. I can have the entire piece for myself. It's that good!\n","\n","-Deep fried coconut milk ( / ): Not really milk. More like a coconut custard ball that's deep fried. Served with some sugar on the side for those who like it sweet. Yes, I dipped it in the sugar. But it tastes just as good without. \n","\n","We also ordered the house special bun which they told us they didn't have but yet it was printed on our order form. Odd... we thought it wouldn't be added to our bill since it wouldn't have been scratched off by the servers and was informed that they didn't have it. Long story short, they did and we had to get them to adjust the bill and when all items and prices looked correct we were ready to pay to find out that they added   bucks to our bill on the machine. Not sure if this was an one time error or is charging their customers a regular thing. Again, we had to find our server to let them know that they entered the wrong amount on the machine. \n","\n","Food was good. Service was ok except for the billing and paying hiccup.\n","I must update the update of my review.  \n","\n","I know I said I'd not be back, but it is \"dine out Vancouver\" and CHOP had a good deal on.  My wife and I decided to take the risk and try it. \n","\n","I can't believe I'm about to say this after reading my last review... but it was really good!\n","\n","We even had Frank again-- same waiter from the disaster-- and he was totally cool.  In fact he was quite good.  \n","\n","The food was amazing and cooked awesome.  The service was back to what I remembered from my first visit.  \n","\n","Yummy. \n","\n","Now I don't know what to do.   Come back or not.   Guess I'll try them again and see if they've made permanent improvements.   \n","\n","Time will tell, but this was a great step!!\n","\n","Good job CHOP!\n","\n","\n","-------------\n","\n","Old update:\n","\n","I can't believe that this is the same restaurant that I reviewed before.  Our first experience here was magnificent, but this time it was totally horrible.  \n","\n","We were greeted at the front by the manager.  He talked too quiet and was hard to hear since the entrance was noisy. He seemed put out that I asked to register my car so I wouldn't have to pay for the expensive hotel parking rates. \n","\n","They led us to a table in the back corner, so it was nice and quiet for our   anniversary dinner (yes we made a reservation and told them this special day when they asked). \n","\n","The host who the manager asked to escort us to the seat told us that Frank would be right with us.  \n","\n","Frank arrived complete with a \"forced-obviously-fake\" smile.  He explained the specials and had trouble remembering the drink special. Then he took off saying that he would be right back when we said water would be fine. \n","\n","The manager who \"welcomed\" us at the front door showed up asking if we wanted drinks.  We said water was fine.  He asked if we would like appetizers.  We said no but we knew what we wanted.   He pulled out a paper and pen and tried to take our order.  My goodness.   We both had to repeat our order three or four times before he got it right.   He also had to open the menu to verify what things came with even though we had already told him.  \n","\n","So, I ordered the \"CHOP Experience\" Teriyaki Sirloin that comes with salad or soup and a choice of one side AND seasonal vegetables.  They forgot the vegetables.   My wife asked.  The waiter looked lost while he remembered if ordered the \"experience\". I was almost finished when they showed up on a side plate. \n","\n","The manager showed up again to fill my water glass.  He reached across the table with the jug and poured.  He nearly took out my face with the jug and his arm required I turned my head so I didn't rub his jacket with my nose. \n","\n","The \"CHOP EXPERIENCE\" is perhaps the wrong wording for this.   They make it sound like this is a good thing.   Something special.  \n","\n","It isn't.  \n","\n","I would like to offer to the chop owners and management that I would be happy to come in and train their staff on how to properly host, seat, serve, and follow up with guests eating at their restaurant.  \n","\n","The place is beautiful.  It is dressed up like a fine dining place and they charge at those rates.   The service, however, is below a fast food place.   At least, in fast food you almost always get what you order.  \n","\n","Finally, they tried to charge me for the salad separately, so the server didn't even check the bill.   Yes they chose not to charge me for the experience.   But still.   \n","\n","Sadly, CHOP has gone from amazing down to I won't be back.\n","Went to dinner with my mom, girl friend, sister and brother in-law.  Me, my girl friend and mom arrive first.  We are seated in a nearly empty restaurant with only   other tables.  I figured service would be alright.  We get seated and my girl friend asks the waiter for   glasses of water which is quickly forgotten about after they bring the tea.\n","\n","We had to ask again for   glasses of water.  My sister and brother in-law have not arrived yet\n","and so we figured we'll order first and have them start cooking it when they arrived.  So my \n","mom orders   dishes and the waiter comes back and says the dishes will be ready in   minutes as the chef prepares them.  We told the the waiter, the other guests have not arrived yet and are not sure when they will be here.  Could you please hold cooking until the rest of the people arrive? We have had many restaurants that have had no issues with this request.  He came back with a snarky remark saying that we should have told him that in the first place and that the chef has already started.  Luckily, the remaining two members just arrived.\n","\n","We got our dishes and the plates were big but the amount of food was small.  The garnish was larger than the food at times.  The food was mostly bland and wasn't anything special.  The only really tasty dish was a fifth chicken dish we ordered.  We were pretty much all finished with a few pieces of food left on a dish here and there.  We couldn't finish it all and as I asked the waiter to doggy baggy it, the guy pushing for us to finish it off the plate,\n","it's only a few pieces. That's rude if you ask me.  I'm full and have not reason to eat more than my fill.\n","\n","After they've cleared the table we receive the standard desert and we had to again wait for a \n","long period of time before we had to usher a waiter to get the bill.  Given the rudeness of the waiter and water not being brought I decided to give them  % as tip.  I also love it when the waiter is watching me like a hawk as I'm entering in my pin, like really is that what you call customer service?\n","\n","I entered only  % tip onto the bill and the waitress gave me my receipt.  As our group was leaving the table one of the waiters comes by with the bill in hand and talks with my girl friend asking for more tip or if I made a  mistake in the tip amount...can you believe that!?  You have the balls to come and ask for more tip thinking that I made a mistake?  If the waiter had come to me, I would have demanded the  % back.  I don't see why any customer should be bullied or guilted into paying more tip than what the customer thinks is right.  \n","\n","The only saving grace for the waiter was the fact that my sister and mother added more to the tip - which I disagreed with but it was their money.  I would recommend staying away from places like these who think that they deserve something for nothing.\n","Came here for a pre-birthday dinner, and this place did not disappoint! Technically a  . , but I'm gving this place an extra half star because our server Remi was absolutely fantastic. He really went out of his way to make everyone feel welcome, and was super nice and friendly. He even gifted me our desserts for my birthday! Prices are reasonable considering that this is a hotel restaurant, and portion sizes are decent. Parking is also free for two hours if you leave your license plate number to the restaurant staff.\n","\n","Fried cauliflower and brussel sprouts ( . / )\n","Great dish, the only thing that I didn't like was the powdered cheese because I hate cheese that's not melted and so yeah. It was kind of my fault though because I knew that there was cheese but I forgot to tell them to get rid of it. My bad. The dipping sauce was great though, and the batter wasn't overly greasy.\n","\n","Calamari ( . / )\n","Loved the sweet chili sauce and the dipping sauce (same as the one above), and again the batter was not too oily. I also liked the addition of the fried onions and bell peppers, as it adds a nice crunch and makes me feel like I'm being healthy even though I'm not because it's all deep fried. Anyway, this was a pretty great dish.\n","\n","Pork adobo ( . / )\n","This was very good, according to the rest of my family. They were skeptical of ordering it at first, but I made them order it because I've heard good things about it on Yelp. It was a good call. The pork was crispy on the top and super tender and flavourful. A definite thumbs up!\n","\n","Seafood chowder ( . / )\n","Wow this chowder was thicc. I was really good though, although I wish there was a little less potato and a little more seafood. \n","\n","Sablefish ( / )\n","This was really good, and a good option if you want a lighter dish. The miso broth was great, and the fish was crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside. \n","\n","  ribeye ( / )\n","This was also a really great dish. The sauce was flavourful, the steak was juicy and tender, and the mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms were pretty good as well.\n","\n","Chocolate cake ( / )\n","This was a great chocolate cake. It's rich, but not too sweet. We really enjoyed this.\n","\n","Mango sorbet ( . / )\n","Shoutout to Remi to giving us   large scoops of the mango sorbet for the whole table to share when we only ordered one. This mango sorbet is the best I've ever had, and according to my brother, who has had over a hundred scoops of mango sorbet in his life (no kidding), this is the best mango sorbet outside of Italy. Seriously, it is so creamy and delightful. You must try this!\n","\n","Overall, I was really pleased with my experience here. The only complaint that I have is that the whole place smelled like cheese powder, which I suppose can't be helped. However, it made me feel kind of nauseous because I can't stand the small of cheese at all. Other than that, this is a great place to dine with friends and family, and I highly recommend this place. We literally did not leave a single crumb behind, and my family members have really small appetites!\n","You have now until Monday, November   to have a taste of the Feast: Asian Dining Festival. For my last stop, I invited my friends to join me at Continental Seafood Restaurant to enjoy a $  set menu for   people. \n","\n","it is my first time dining here. When I was selecting which restaurants to go, the menu from Continental Seafood Restaurant immediately attracted me. It is a  -course menu that can feed   people. I invited four friends to tag along, and it was exciting for me because it has been a long time since I have such a fancy Chinese meal. \n","\n","The first two dishes are Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup and Roasted Pork with BBQ Duck. The soup is beyond my expectation, with a generous amount of crab meat and pieces of fish maw in it. The big bowl can fill up to   small bowls, so my friends can go for the second round! I love the crispy skin from the roasted pork, and the ratio of fat and meat is perfect. \n","\n","The Sautee Jumbo Prawn with Superior Soya Sauce arrives next. Again, I am surprised by the portion, which I believe it has more than   jumbo prawns in the dish. It is flavorful, but unfortunately, I wish the prawn itself can absorb more of the soy sauce flavor. It tastes somewhat bland on its own. \n","\n","The next dish is the one that excites me the most - Braised Lamb with Bamboo & Chinese Mushroom in Hot Pot. Lettuce is included on the side. Putting lettuce in the braised lamb hotpot is a common thing to see, as it can absorb all the flavors from the sauce. This type of hotpot is rare and often expensive in Vancouver. Therefore, I am surprised to see this on the menu. The lamb is tender and flavorful! I would totally order this again next time I am here. \n","\n","The last two dishes are also as fabulous as the others - Pan Fried Black Cod with Soya Sauce and Sticky Rice with Preserved Meat & Sausage. The black cod is cooked and seasoned perfectly. It is soft and flaky, but I hope it is more \"pan-fried\" than deep-fried as it looks they dipped the fish into corn starch prior to pan-frying it.\n","\n","The sticky rice is one of the best sticky rice I have eaten in Vancouver. You might think I sound exaggerated, but I love the egg strings are so thin that the flavor is in every ingredient of the dish. It is not overly seasoned, and I won't feel too heavy after eating more than a bowl.\n","\n","Unfortunately, we didn't get the dessert, which is also included in the set menu because we were too full with quite a bit of leftover. The server offers us red bean sweet soup and fortune cookies. \n","\n","*** Overall Impression ***\n","\n","Continental Seafood Restaurant is rated at  . / , and I think it totally worth at least  . / . Almost all of the dishes are perfectly seasoned and cooked, and with this $  set menu, it can probably feed more than   people. If you do the math, each person is paying around $ -  after tips and tax, which is reasonable for a fancy, high-quality  -course meal. The restaurant is spacious and clean, with good service. I will definitely return on my own time to try their dim sum and get the Braised Lamb Hot Pot once again. \n","\n","Taste :  . /  * Service:  . /  * Ambiance:  . /  * Quality-Price:  / \n","The food was alright. But I am going to focus on the service in this post. \n","\n","So we had a dinner reservation for  . We were greeted promptly upon telling the hostess our reservation information and we were seated quite quickly. About   minutes upon being seated, I received a phone call from Boston Pizza asking if we are planning to take the table we reserved for. It is not a very big deal but at the same time it tells me that the team is not very organized and there is a lack of attention to customers. I honestly do not think it is that hard to keep track of who has arrived and who hasn't. But again I will give the benefit of the doubt that it is New Year's Eve and it is busy. So this was not a huge deal.\n"," \n","When we made the reservation we were asked if we would prefer to have one bill or split the bill. We actually appreciated that gesture as that would save everyone's time in the end. But then we were asked two more times throughout the night if we would like to split the bill. Again I understand it is busy but if you are not going to keep track of our decision we might as well just save it till the end and be asked only once. After we got our food, we wanted to ask for pepper and cheese but the server was no where to be found for a long while. Later we got to ask for more water during our meal, which also never came. When we were finished and we asked for the bill, we were not asked if we wanted any dessert or drinks to follow, it is a little thing but it just added to our overall disappointment on the level of service provided.\n","\n","Then the bill took   minutes to arrive.  Part of our party of   wanted to pay with card so we asked for the machine. And it was another   minutes before our server came by again and said she will be right with us. After which we waited another   minutes and still nothing. At this point we were already quite frustrated as it was a pure waste of time. So we went to the front counter and asked to pay and mentioned that we had to wait for a long time, and then they took another   minutes looking for our server to get to the front in order to finish our payment. This part was very confusing to us as to why the person at the counter could not just take our card. Regardless of how busy it might be, I do not believe it is reasonable for it to take   minutes before we can finish paying. Though Boston Pizza pricing is very affordable, as paying customers we still expect there to be basic service. \n","\n","In the end we left feeling neglected and annoyed with the whole dining experience. This was not our first visit to this location, the service has always been mediocre at best but never this horrible.\n","I actually ate here not making this the destination, but because of visiting the vendor next door to even notice this place. I didn't use the trusty Yelp app and even read Marc D's review and magically ordered the same thing he wrote about (meat pie), I guess Yelper's think alike, and I waited patiently for this dish and decided to read the 'other' review on this place and after reading it started salivating on what I was going to sink my teeth into.\n","\n","In big red Chinese letters stating 'RED LANTERN' wasn't what brought me here, and oddly enough I didn't really look up at the few pictured items, with the pork meat pie priced at $ , to make me order this, I actually looked through their smaller pictured item menu below, and I was drawn to this thing, way more than the onion pancake. In Chinese, this thing was called the Beijing meat cake (I think this is the closest I can describe this as) and something about meat between doughy pastry that is cooked fresh was what I was searching for on this wet and soggy day.\n","\n","The woman who took my order spoke Mandarin to me, and my horrible Steven Chow Mandarin/Cantonese tried to order this dish, successfully I might add. Sitting in the food court I waited for about   minutes, it could have been longer, I wasn't counting, but what I did know was that this thing was being made fresh on that grill, covered, and cooking hot. When the dish was ready, she eyed me, and said to come over to get my food, served on a tray, she asked if I would like vinegar, and I had a small plastic dipping dish for this, even though I did not know if it would go well, but if they are already serving this with it, I might as well take it.\n","\n","The size of this thing was almost like a personal sized pizza, it was not try, as most of the sauciness was oozing from the freshly cooked meat sandwiched between the pastry. The meat was juicy, moist, hot, homey with the pastry just made it feel like you were somewhere in Northern China, whether this dish was served in a restaurant or the back of an outhouse, this dish would be great. Not much on presentation, but once you have a bite, everything feels warm. Dipping each bite with the dark vinegar enhanced the taste, and my partner had to ask the woman working to reload on the vinegar as what we got was not enough. While sitting in the food court I noticed other people ordering this dish from this stall, obviously the more popular of plates. \n","\n","I will definitely come back, and order this, and have more confidence trying their other things but one to put on my radar, and a reason to come to this food court.\n","\n","Oh, and Marc D. the answer to the name of the dish is like what I said: Beijing Meat Cake is what the translation word to word is!\n","I don't have much experience with their other franchise locations, but have been to this Richmond location on quite a few occasions. There is not much selection on the menu. There are a selection of small appetizer dishes and only one entree - Chinese Sauerkraut Fish. If you cannot handle spicy, more specifically the numbing spice, and don't like sour foods, this spot will not be for you. Also, don't let the pictures fool you on the spice levels. Just because the colour of sauerkraut fish broth isn't a flaming red doesn't mean it will be milder than the average Sichuan spice. I would say it is at least   times spicier than your regular Sichuan boiled fish dish. \n","\n","I went on a weeknight for my first visit, after they had only been open for about a month. It was crazy how packed the place was on Wednesday night. We had made a reservation, but since we were running   minutes late, we ended up having to wait about   minutes for the next available table as they were not able to hold our original table. We also realized we had made a mistake coming in a large group of   because the largest table barely fit   people. After my initial experience with this spot, I just learned to avoid the dinner rush and only go in smaller groups. Also, I think now that they have been around for a while, they are not as packed as they were when they first opened. \n","\n","This place is quite pricey, but honestly not by much compared to other spicy boiled fish dishes in the area, especially considering they are not using cheap cod or basa fillets. The whole fish is completely deboned and sliced thinly with the skin on. The head and tail of the fish is deep fried and served in the broth as well. I have had an occasion where I ordered the largest size (\"boss\" size), which is supposed to have   whole fish's worth of meat, but the heads and tails were not served. This made me question if there is actually   whole fish in the dish. \n","\n","The sauerkraut is made in-house, which I think really makes a difference. I am not usually a big fan of sauerkraut, but I found their sauerkraut a very refreshing in the broth and deepens the flavour of the other spices in the broth. It also lightens up the dish too, not making you feel too bloated after you're done. \n","\n","You can get add-ins for the broth as well, such as noodles, mushrooms, tofu etc. Note that these add-ins cost extra for the two smaller sizes, but   add-ins come free with the largest size. Quite frankly, if not included, I would skip the add-ons because the portions are quite small and price tag is high. My suggestion instead would be to order a bowl of rice to have on the side. The rice paired with the sauerkraut fish make for a perfect match, and helps cut the spice. \n","\n","The side dishes are worth a try, but a little pricey in my opinion. I have tried the chicken wings, the sliced beef in chili oil, and the sweet rice cakes. Based on the side dishes I have tried, I would say you can forgo the wings and the beef, but the rice cakes are a must try. The others were good, but nothing special. Focus on the sauerkraut fish. \n","\n","The staff, like at most Richmond restaurants, are very no-frills, so there is not much to comment on in terms of service. The restaurant atmosphere is hip and young. My relatives from China told me that the franchise locations in China will not let you pack leftovers to go and have a strict   person/table limit, so they quite appreciate the flexibility/courtesy of this overseas location. However, taste-wise they still prefer the locations in China, though the Richmond branch is close enough to satisfy the cravings.\n","I've never written a review for any restaurants before, but the service and attitude I got from my server tonight was worse than poor, leaving no tip on my bill was generous enough on my end. \n","\n","This was not my first visit. If anything, I've been coming here for years and have recommended people to come here because they had a great selection of food and had assorted sushi & sashimi to boot. I thought that was great! Service at an AYCE hot pot place will never be top notch, but that's to be expected. Some food items may not show up even though my friends and I would order them, but we shrugged them off because we could just re-order them no problem. Before tonight, I usually picked this spot for hot hot because the food was pretty great.\n","\n","Tonight's visit will be my very last. I've never been talked to so rudely, to the point where it's like I'm being scolded by my mother, except this lady is FAR worse. She was a chinese woman, in a high side ponytail with rectangle glasses. I was seated right away, despite arriving early for my reservation, which I thought was kind of the hostess. My friend was running   minutes late, but that wasn't a problem. However, my server came over to me and asked me if I had chosen a soup base yet. I told her I wasn't ready because my friend hadn't arrived yet, but she will be here in a few minutes so I told her to come back after we had decided. She completely ignored my answer and told me to choose a soup base because we only had an hour and   minutes to eat our food, which was more than enough time for my friend and I. No, she refused my answer and FORCED me to pick a soup base. So I chose one, not knowing what I actually wanted and literally,   seconds later, my friend arrived and much to her dismay, she didn't like the soup base I chose (and neither did I!). \n","\n","I called the server down to let her know we wanted to split up our soup base and choose different soup bases, however she rudely told us she put the order through already. I straight up told her it wasn't my fault we had to choose because if she had listened to me, we would've given her NO TROUBLE and told her which soup bases we wanted. She gave us a very dirty look and said she would cancel our first request in a very sarcastic tone. How rude! First, don't assume that it will take us over an hour and   minutes to eat - you should NEVER assume anything about your customers. Second, don't glare down at me if I kindly told her my friend was about to arrive so that we can choose our soup base. \n","\n","After this happened, I wasn't too bothered. My friend and I enjoyed the food (however, surprised that the menu shrunk down significantly since our last visit), and the service continued to be mundane and the food came out really slowly. Then, we were finally ready to go. My friend proceeded to go to the bathroom and I asked our server for the bill. Before she said yes, she looked at our empty plates, hot pot bowl, and then our scrubby left-over sashimi pieces, she told me to finish up our food. I told her we were full and everything was pretty much empty except for the sashimi. She said I HAD to finish my food. When I refused again, she mentioned something about charging extra for wasting food. So I had no choice but to eat the last bit of food. At that point, I decided not to give her a tip and this will be my last visit. \n","\n","I've never been this upset ever. I've never been talked down to and treated like I'm some kid who doesn't know any better. Plates and cups were pretty dirty, but that's a whole other story. I'm never coming back to this place and I hope they know they lost a regular customer. I've told my friends and family to check out this place for the past couple of years and now I'm telling them to go else-where. I don't even think a manager would read this, but for those who took the time to read my review, please re-consider your visit to this place. Everything has been going downhill since my first visit a few years back, but I still came back because of the food. However, the service tonight left a really bad taste in my mouth and I hope to save you the trouble of going there and try other better hot pot places in
